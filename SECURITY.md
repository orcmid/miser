**2024-09-18 Status**: At this time there are no code releases for which there
need be any vulnerability and exploit concerns.

Current repository content consists of text files and web documentation of an
experimental/provisional nature with limited use of SML for proofs-of-concept.

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are generally unwarranted at this
time.
