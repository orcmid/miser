<!-- ---1----|----2----|----3----|----4----|----5----|----6----|----7----|--*
     security.md 1.0.11            UTF-8                        dh:2024-09-19
     -->
**2024-09-19 Status**: At this time there are no code releases for which there
need be any vulnerability and exploit concerns.

Current repository content consists of text files and web documentation of an
experimental/provisional nature with limited use of SML for proofs-of-concept.

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are unwarranted at this time.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| none    | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface,
please use the GitHub vulnerability reporting provision of the
[Miser Security](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/security) tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication,
send a digitally-signed plaintext email to [orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

If you wish encrypted responses, also sign that email in order for
your public key to be used for that.

## Exclusion of Forked Projects

When the Miser Project is forked using GitHub, the README.md and SECURITY.md
files will be included.  So long as synchronized updates from the Miser
Project are desired, all development in the fork should occur on a separate
fork-unique branch.

For independent releases of a fork-based project, it must be clear that there
is no support at the Miser Project and the Security Policy does not extend to
the fork.
