**2024-11-09 Status**: At this time there are no code releases for which there
need be any vulnerability and exploit concerns.

Current repository content consists of text files and web documentation of an
experimental/provisional nature with limited use of SML for proofs-of-concept.

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are unwarranted at this time.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| none    | :x:                |

## Finding Miser Project Vulnerability Announcements

Public vulnerability announcements confirm vulnerabilities, reporting their
nature, their mitigation, and any actions required by those who may be
employing vulnerable software versions. Occassionally, a vulnerability
announcement can explain why a particular situation does not qualify as a
vulnerability.

Find already-issued public vulnerability announcements, if any, for the
Miser project/repository at
[miser advisories](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/security/advisories).

## Reporting a Miser Project Vulnerability

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
that pertains to the Miser Project, however unlikely, use the GitHub
vulnerability reporting provision of the
[Miser Project Security](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/security) tab.

See the
[orcmid.github.io Security Sandbox](https://orcmid.github.io/SECURITY.html)
for examples of what to expect, how to kick off a vulnerability report, and
alternative reporting options.

## Exclusion of Forked/Cloned Projects

For independent releases of a fork-/clone-based project, it must be clear that
there is no support commitment at the Miser Project and the Security Policy
does not extend to the fork/clone.
