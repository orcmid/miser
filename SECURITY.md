# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**2024-09-04 Status**: At this time there are no code releases for which there need be any vulnerability and exploit concerns.
Current repository content consists of text files and web documentation of an experimental/provisional nature with limited use of
SML for proofs-of-concept.

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are 
generally unwarranted at this time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe there is need to engage in a private discussion about a potential threat or threat-surface defect, please use the GitHub
vulerability reporting provision of this project's Security tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to 
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have concerns about email security/privacy, enclose an ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc) public key.
