## Supported Versions

**2024-09-04 Status**: At this time there are no code releases for which there
need be any vulnerability and exploit concerns.

Current repository content consists of text files and web documentation of an
experimental/provisional nature with limited use of SML for proofs-of-concept.

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are generally unwarranted at this
time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe there is need to engage in a private discussion about a
potential threat or threat-surface defect, please use the GitHub
vulnerability reporting provision of this repository/project Security tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have concerns about email security/privacy, enclose an ASCII-armored
PGP-encrypted text file using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.
