**2024-09-24 Status**: At this time there are no code releases for which there
need be any vulnerability and exploit concerns.

Current repository content consists of text files and web documentation of an
experimental/provisional nature with limited use of SML for proofs-of-concept.

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are unwarranted at this time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that have
supported releases.

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
that pertains to the Miser Project, however unlikely, use the GitHub
vulnerability reporting provision of the
[Miser Project Security](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/security) tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

Finally, if you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before
encryption in order for your public key to be available for that purpose.

## Exclusion of Forked/Cloned Projects

When the Miser Project is forked/cloned using GitHub, the README.md and
SECURITY.md files will be included.  So long as synchronized updates from the
Miser Project are desired in a GitHub fork, all development should occur on a
separate and fork-distinct branch.

For independent releases of a fork/clone-based project, it must be clear that
there is no support commitment at the Miser Project and the Security Policy
does not extend to the fork/clone.  Independent release branches from a GitHub
fork/clone should be with README.md, SECURITY.md, LICENSE.txt, and NOTICE.txt
versions, if any, that prevent confusion with supported Miser Project code.
Attribution to the Miser Project origin is expected, in compliance with the
Miser Project license.
