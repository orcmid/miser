                   OFRUGAL REPL DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION
                   --------------------------------------

    oFrugal is the the REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) component of the pair

     - oMiser representation and use of the abstract structure, ‹ob› as an
       encapsulated data-structure and universal machine implementation via
       reusable program library.

     - oFrugal front-end processor offering an interface for external
       exercise of oMiser functions in a more-practical form for personal
       exploration and operation of oMiser programs.

    oFrugal implementations provide input-output and other functions
    that oMiser necessarily lacks.  oFrugal is essentially a kind
    of assembler of oMiser obs and a means to exercise programs
    written as obs that compute other obs from given ones.  In particular,
    it presents the results of computations in the same notation(s) employed
    for the inputs.

TODO

  * Create these, with attention to the division of labor and the reliance
    on the common ob-exp txt.

  * Add attribution statement.

  * Explain the oMiser mockup case because of file-system location of
    SML scripts.  There needs to be some principle applied on this.
