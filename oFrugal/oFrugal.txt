                   OFRUGAL REPL DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION
                   --------------------------------------

    oFrugal is the REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) component of the pair

     - oMiser representation and use of the abstract structure, ‹ob› as an
       encapsulated data-structure and universal machine implementation via
       reusable program library.

     - oFrugal front-end processor offering an interface for external
       exercise of oMiser functions in a more-practical form for personal
       exploration and operation of oMiser programs.

    oFrugal implementations provide input-output and other functions that
    oMiser necessarily lacks.  oFrugal is essentially an assembler/calculator
    of oMiser obs, a means to exercise scripts written as obs that compute
    other obs by applicative interpretation.  In particular, oFrugla presents
    the results of computations in the same notation(s) employed for inputs.

TODO

  * Create these, with attention to the division of labor and the reliance
    on the common ob-exp txt.

  * Explain the oMiser mockup case because of file-system location of
    SML scripts.  There needs to be some principle applied on this.

  * Maybe need notes and references?
