                OFRUGAL MOCKUP EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS
                ------------------------------------------

    oFrugal mockups are proof-of-concept demonstrations using available
    programming-language arrangements.  They tend to work with and depend
    upon corresponding oMiser mockups at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/mockups>

    The mockups are not production level.  They need only be simple enough
    and sufficient for demonstration of oMiser and oFrugal representations.
    A different framework will be employed for spiral development of stable,
    production releases with more-appealing stability, performance, and
    interchange of developed computational-model scripts.

    The first mockups are written in Standard ML and processed using Standard
    ML of New Jersey.  Down the road, the affinity with SML/NJ and its roots
    in Logic for Computable Functions will be examined more closely.

TODO

  * Document the SML mockups sufficient for others to replicate and also
    contribute to the work.

  * Choose among F#, Java, Python, JavaScript and Clean C COM demonstrations
    for further confirmations of the ‹ob› computational model at the oMiser level.
