               OFRUGAL PROOF-OF-CONCEPT DEMONSTRATIONS IN SML
               ----------------------------------------------

    Standard SML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) is used for demonstration
    of the essential characteristics of Miser obs and the universal
    computational functions on obs, obap.ap(p,x) and obap.eval(exp).

    The objective is demonstration of an oFrugal REPL with standard
    parsing and pretty-printed output presentation.  REPL operation
    will be limited to ASCII code points in input-output texts although
    Unicode is required of complete implementations.

    As a mockup, there is little diagnostic support and one will simply
    have to be meticulous about confirming the implementation of code via
    obs used as procedure scripts.

SETUP

    The constructions of SML oFrugal mockups rely on corresponding
    constructions of SML oMiser mockups.  For SML setup and use, consult
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/mockups/SML/SML.txt>

TODO

  * Use the SML oMiser mockup development to determine how to integrate the
    oMiser ob structures and signatures for access by oFrugal structures,
    signatures, and the REPL code.

  * Give consideraton to nfoTools here, even though mockups with SML are maybe
    not so meticulous.
