                     OFRUGALESE LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
                     ---------------------------------

    The oFrugal REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) console application
    processes lines of input as a continuous stream of material.  That
    stream is required to conform to the oFrugalese language specification.

TODO

 * Incorporate shared references from ob-exp.txt with regard to the grammar
   and the use of 〈ob-exp〉.

 * Provide the interpretation of ‼〈binding-name〉{ℰ} where
   〈binding-name〉 ::= ^〈plane-lindy〉 | ?〈plane-lindy〉 | ?.〈plane-lindy〉

 * Provide a look-up function that works on that returns matches for
   certain lookups and returns the ? form when it is not there is no
   established binding.

 * Establish that all grammatically-correct streams have interpretations,
   though an attempted computation may fail by resource exhaustion.

 * Produce the input-statements grammar to first just have binding commands
   and expressions.

 * Add #include and see how that works.

 * Start a table of contents

 * Address the overall structure

 * Address error-reporting/-handling.

 * Provide the environment that is used to add accumulate binding and supply
   them to ob-exp interpretations.

 * Include file and line identification in the handling of REPL sessions and
   provide for error identification/location messages that are useful in
   locating problem points in the input source.

 * Consider line-numbering in the entry of input or maybe only in a CUA editor
   or maybe even in Visual Studio Code.
