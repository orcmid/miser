                   OFRUGAL REPL MINDELAY PARSER DESIGN
                   -----------------------------------

SYNOPSIS TBD

 - Define what we mean

 - Talk about the effective translation to reverse polish but with the
   evaluation of every operation whose individual operands have been
   determined

 - talk about how the same could be used for building an expression that
   would not be evaluated until it has been completely parsed successfully

 - talk about the difficulties of error handling

 - Set up the precedence rules for the variant cases.

 - Identify the format for error messages

TODO

  * mindelay.txt is the REPL parser structure.  It is related to the Alan
    Perlis "mindelay-scan-doer" scheme for a mostly one-pass process where
    an operation can be carried out as soon as its operands are determined.
    For oFrugal that one-pass process calculates obs and provides for the
    binding of obs and the access to those bound obs in subsequent
    expressions.  This is a moderately-extended precedence parser.  Behavior
    of this parser procedure can be verified against the context-free grammar
    for the same oFrugal texts.  The handling of error cases is beyond what
    the grammar determines.

  * "mindelayscandoer" is described as "scan and do translation to final code
    as quickly as possible" in footnote 2 on p.37 of A. Evans Jr., A. J.
    Perlis, and H. Van Zoeren.  The Use of Threaded Lists in Construction of a
    Combined ALGOL and Machine-Like Assembly Processor.  Comm. ACM 4, 1 (Jan.
    1961), 36-41.  DOR <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/366062.366081>.  I feel
    that I had seen an earlier use of the term in something earlier.  For
    oFrugal mindelay is even shorter, since the REPL is essentially a
    calculator and it derives interpretations as quickly as all dependencies
    are in hand.  mindelay.txt will account for the downside of that approach.

  * Also reference Knuth and the cellar principle folk, along with the paper
    on Precedence languages by Bob Floyd.  The use of a precedence-based
    parser is also aligned with the mindelay concept, since it basically
    turns the input into a reverse polish form where every operation can be
    performed when an operator is added to the stream.
