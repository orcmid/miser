                   OFRUGAL REPL MINDELAY PARSER DESIGN
                   -----------------------------------

MINDELAYSCANDOER

    A mindelayscandoer refers to programming-language compiling techniques
    in which the the scanning of the text leads provides translation to final
    computer code as quickly as possible [Evans1961:n.2].  This tends to be
    associated with translation that occurs in a single pass over the text.

    In the case of the oFrugal REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) there is no
    production of code.  The oFrugal REPL is more like a calculator, in that
    it accepts expressions in the oFrugal REPL language and delivers a
    canonical expression for the calculated ob.

    In the proof-of-concept oFrugal REPL, evaluations happen as soon as the
    operands of an operation are available in the parsing of the input being
    read. The idea is to minimize drag, the amount of intermediate results
    that must be held onto until their consuming operations are determined.
    In this manner, the parsing of the input and performance of operations
    occur as the scanning progresses.

    Although the oFrugal REPL operates about as quickly as conceivable, there
    are difficulties with regard to errors in the input and troubles in the
    evaluations.  Any of these can cause the scanning to cease.  The remedy
    is by not performing any evaluations until a complete REPL expression has
    been scanned, delaying the required operations until the expression is
    scanned completely and successfully. In effect, the operations are kept
    in a compiled form that is then "executed" after a successful parse.

    The proof-of-concept oFrugal REPL implementation will not delay any
    evaluations.  Once the operands of an operation are in-hand, the operation
    will be performed.  Fortunately, the same parsing technique is applicable,
    later, by having operations produce an intermediate for their delayed
    evaluation when the input is parsed completely and successfully.

GRAMMATICAL ACCURACY

    The early operator-precedence techniques tended to be under-specified.
    In particular, some grammatically-incorrect strings were accepted and
    would produce results even though the input is malformed [Samelson1969].

    This stemmed partly from the development of operands and intermediates
    on a different stack than one holding the as-yet-uncompleted syntactic
    components. It becomes possible for the two stacks to become out of
    sync, either accepting an ungrammatical input or having an operation fail.
    This can be a reflection of there being no formal grammar that the input
    is held to.

    For the oFrugal REPL, every input must be grammatical, and every accepted
    input will have an applicative interpretation.

ERROR HANDLING


 - talk about the difficulties of error handling

 - Set up the precedence rules for the variant cases.

 - Identify the format for error messages

 - Identify the idea about association of interpretations to the patterns

       Footnote 2 on p.37 describes "mindelayscandoer" as "scan and do
    translation to final code as quickly as possible."  The idea of
    threaded lists does not apply well to oMiser, though a counterpart
    might assist in operator-precedence handling.

       Floyd provides a mechanical means of producing precedence parsers
    when grammars are specified in a form for which definite precedence
    conditions can be derived.  The special case of assigning numerical
    precedence values to syntactic features and then comparing those,
    among other enhancements, are found by formal means.  The full
    analysis technique is particularly valuable in testing that a grammar
    admits operator-precedence parsing simplicity and automatic production
    is valuable when modifications of the language are anticipated.

       The explanation of operator precedence and its illustration is very
    close to how the oFrugal REPL parser will parse and interpret ob-exp
    formulas.

       This technique has found considerable favor at varous points in
    time.  Section 1, Survey of the Problem Domain, and early parts
    of section 2, Three Syntactic Issues, are valuable for considerations
    of the desire for operator precedence simplicity. The technique
    depends on the creation of procedures that apply to various elements
    in the course of parsing that is not quite how interpretation is
    specified for the oFrugal grammar.  The considerations do apply.

       This paper describes a cellar (ie., stack) principle for
    translation of algorithmic expressions, treating precedence of infix
    operators. The stack of (intermediate) operands is kept separate.

TODO

  * mindelay.txt is the REPL parser structure.  It is related to the Alan
    Perlis "mindelay-scan-doer" scheme for a mostly one-pass process where
    an operation can be carried out as soon as its operands are determined.
    For oFrugal that one-pass process calculates obs and provides for the
    binding of obs and the access to those bound obs in subsequent
    expressions.  This is a moderately-extended precedence parser.  Behavior
    of this parser procedure can be verified against the context-free grammar
    for the same oFrugal texts.  The handling of error cases is beyond what
    the grammar determines.

  * "mindelayscandoer" is described as "scan and do translation to final code
    as quickly as possible" in footnote 2 on p.37 of A. Evans Jr., A. J.
    Perlis, and H. Van Zoeren.  The Use of Threaded Lists in Construction of a
    Combined ALGOL and Machine-Like Assembly Processor.  Comm. ACM 4, 1 (Jan.
    1961), 36-41.  DOR <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/366062.366081>.  I feel
    that I had seen an earlier use of the term in something earlier.  For
    oFrugal mindelay is even shorter, since the REPL is essentially a
    calculator and it derives interpretations as quickly as all dependencies
    are in hand.  mindelay.txt will account for the downside of that approach.

  * Also reference Knuth and the cellar principle folk, along with the paper
    on Precedence languages by Bob Floyd.  The use of a precedence-based
    parser is also aligned with the mindelay concept, since it basically
    turns the input into a reverse polish form where every operation can be
    performed when an operator is added to the stream.
