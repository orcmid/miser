TODO

  * Consider whether different packagings may be served better by having
    separate GitHub projects, perhaps tied to particular implementation/
    integration approaches?

  * For now, consider the development approach to be addressed here.  Where
    incremental releases of various integrations are source-code managed
    can be factored in once we have one and are looking for a second.

  * Describe the development principles with respect to having a shallow
    end to the pool and easy confirmability.
