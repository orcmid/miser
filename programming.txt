TODO

 * Begin developing notes on programming using the oFrugal notations
   and the oFrugal REPL.

 * The direct access to an oMiser implementation is a different kind
   of programming.  Distinguish this.

 * The reusability and substitution at the oFrugal and oMiser levels
   is an engineering matter.

 * Mine the GitHub issues for materials to be included in the
   description of programming.

 * There needs to be tie-in with the theory and interpretation,
   but with a shallow-end approach.   This is facilitated by having
   an oFrugal REPL to operate with.

 * Provide a programming.md file at some point.

 * Need a block diagram for the REPL operation and also shows how
   definitions are captured and updated.
