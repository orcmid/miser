    oMiser/     development of oMiser distributions

    ACM-DL-2026-02-12-1436-FriedmanNotes.txt
                Some papers with Daniel Friedman that caught my eye while
                unsuccessfully searching for something else in the ACM DL.
                Of possible interest to examine farther here.

NOTES AND TODO

  * Create a substructure for oMiser and oFrugal construction that initially
    has oMiser be a cached build for oFrugal and they spiral together.

  * Consider whether different packagings may be served better by having
    separate GitHub projects, perhaps tied to particular implementation/
    integration approaches?

  * For now, consider the development approach to be addressed here.  Where
    incremental releases of various integrations are source-code managed
    can be factored in once we have one and are looking for a second.

  * Describe the development principles with respect to having a shallow
    end to the pool and easy confirmability.

  * Look into multi-platform support at the potential production library
    level for C/C++ constructed libraries for oMiser and using oMiser.
    Reconcile with the desire to minimize tooling and preservation of
    an on-ramp for enthusiasts, students, and novices.

  * E.g.,
  <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/04/24/announcing-a-single-c-library-manager-for-linux-macos-and-windows-vcpkg/>
  and
  <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/09/19/vcpkg-a-tool-to-acquire-and-build-c-open-source-libraries-on-windows/>
  with particular interest in how "repeatable builds" are achieved.

  * Noticing that <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg> depends on Powershell,
    and that interferes with the "shallow-end" and minimal tooling notions
    I have been attempting for nfoTools.

  * [2026-02-13] POSSIBLE RESOURCES.
    I found a citation to Friedman about CONS should not evaluate, before
    Henry Baker's use of the notion. I just can't find it, but I did find
    these of possible interest for oMiser, but unlikely.  These might
    suggest alternatives for me though.
