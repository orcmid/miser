                      ==============================

                      TEST CASES FOR OMISER RELEASES
                      ------------------------------

  <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/devLab/oMiser/tests/tests.txt>


    Files in this directory are for different test cases used to confirm
    or demonstrate cases of oMiser usage and operation.

    The most important testing of oMiser will be accomplished as a run-time
    part of oFrugal development, confirmation, and distribution.

    Beside basic operational confirmation, there will also be some stress
    testing involving instrumentation and timing of different ways to use
    the oMiser API and also the underlying representation under more-direct
    usage.

NOTES AND TODO

 * Confirm binding of an oMiser instance. The first case of this is to confirm
   that the [Visual Studio] C++ and C memory mappings both work and they yield
   the same objects.  There has to be some consideration of how C++ allocates
   and frees instances, versus how it will be done at the C Language level.

 * Confirm operation of the initial COM Interface, including in-operative
   cases and unsuccessful QueryInterface operations.

 * I need to stress those instrumented elements of oMiser.  We need to decide
   whether instrumentation can be permanent or not, and how controlled.
