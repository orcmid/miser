                          OMISER USE OF HRESULTS
                          ======================

    HRESULTs are a convention for returning, possibly passing-on, result codes
    from API functions.  Although heavily employed in Microsoft Windows and
    the Component Object Model (COM) on several platforms, these codes are
    adopted for the oMiser API in a manner consistent with interoperaable
    operation of COM-style interfaces and methods on additional platforms.

    Although harmonious with the use in COM operations, this does not imply
    that oMiser will be distributed as a COM library.  Nevertheless HRESULTs
    are used in the COM-compatible APIs relied upon in oFrugal.

    Common HRESULT values are used where applicable.  For oMiser-specific
    error codes, the HRESULT extension mechanism is used.

    These are the common ones from facilities 0 (FACILITY_NULL) and 7
    (FACILITY_WIN32), as described by Microsoft:

              S_OK 0x00000000 Success
           S_FALSE 0x00000001 Success
         E_NOTIMPL 0x80004001 Not implemented
     E_NOINTERFACE 0x80004002 No such interface supported
         E_POINTER 0x80004003 Pointer that is not valid
           E_ABORT 0x80004004 Operation aborted
            E_FAIL 0x80004006 Unspecified failure
      E_UNEXPECTED 0x8000FFFF Unexpected failure
    E_ACCESSDENIED 0x80070005 General access denied error
          E_HANDLE 0x80070006 Handle that is not valid (not oMiser applicable)
     E_OUTOFMEMORY 0x8007000E Failed to allocated necessary memory
      E_INVALIDARG 0x80070057 One or more arguments are not valid

    The FACILITY_ITF (4), with HRESULTs 0x8004xxxx is for interface-specific
    responses to use of a particular interface.  These are specified in
    conjunction with individual interface contracts.  Any new ones required
    by oMiser will be in this category.  They will have codes of 0x80040200
    or greater to avoid ones COM uses for some of its interfaces.  This is
    according to [Rogerson1997] even though that may be dated information.
    Playing safe here.

NOTES AND TODOS

 * This will ultimately be a PGP-signed distributed src.txt in a snapshot
   bundle.

 * I need a block of GUIDs that should last for all the interfaces we will
   need.

 * Find the original COM specification.  It is out there.

 * I need a block of HRESULTs and definition of oFrugal method-specific ones.
