NOTES AND TODOS

 * For SpitBall, add a CLSID slot to the state fixture.  This is not exposed
   by any method, but reachable by instrumentation and testing of the various
   editions.  It can also be displayed by test harnesses.

 * This will ultimately be a PGP-signed distributed src.txt in a snapshot
   bundle.

 * I need a block of GUIDs that should last for all the interfaces we will
   need.

 * I need a block of GUIDs and I'll need those to be listed in some
   convenient place.  How GUIDs are stored somewhere for use by users of the
   oMiser (COM) interfaces is an interesting problem.  I also need to have a
   good way to cope with versioning of GUIDs tied to particular releases of
   oMiser.  This starts on p.111 of "Inside COM."  (I'm not sanguine about
   how that book describes things.  I will have to provide a better account.)

 * I also need a fast way to recognize primitives. Not just that it is a
   primitive, but which one, to streamline eval and ap acting on them without
   much nesting conditionals and matchings.

 * I would like to get away from windows.h, but I'm uncertain how to get away
   without it.  I'm already stuck with HRESULT and GUID, going to deal with
   ppv's and the various definitions around them.

 * I need to figure out how to use the COM materials without dragging in all
   of the windows.h gunk that I don't want.

 * In whatever scheme I use, I need to confirm that the calling conventions
   and the virtual method scheme are honored, and the structs work.
