NOTES AND TODOS

 * I need to figure out where to link to this that's maybe in a better
   location, but probably not.

 * Once there's any seedling of oMiser at ../../oMiser, we'll switch to using
   ../mkOFrugal.bat (that's in oFrugal/dev/), and scrub this src.txt to a
   typical version that could be bundled into a snapshot.

 * This will ultimately be a PGP-signed distributed src.txt in a snapshot
   bundle.
