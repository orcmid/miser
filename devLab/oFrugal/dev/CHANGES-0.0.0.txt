                       ============================

   <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/oFrugal/*SOMETHING*/CHANGES-0.0.0.txt>

                    CHANGES MADE FOR oFrugal REPL 0.0.0
                    -----------------------------------

    This file provides tracking of changes made to oFrugal as part of
    developing oFrugal 0.0.1 (seedling) as the successor of oFrubal 0.0.0
    (sprout).  These changes are documented in the release information at
    <https://orcmid.github.com/miser/oFrugal/*something-something*/>.

    Further information on the development of oFrugal 0.0.1 can be found
    at the GitHub project, <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/projects/>,
    and Miser Project issues, <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/issues>.

CHANGES IN 0.0.1
****************

**THIS FILE** is boilerplate for further customization when there is any
distribution and and changes are worth describing.  We probably need to have
bundled a distribution as maybe 0.1.0 (alpha) and then there will be this
for whatever the next distribution is.

BREAKING: Probably not, more about progressive improvements.

IMPORTANT: With this change, oFrugal-0.1.0 is not a simple drop-in
replacement for oFrugal-0.0.0.  The workflow within which oFrugal is used
must be adjusted for the changed command prompt.

    oFrugal [+] ?
    oFrugal [+] whatever

Note 2:

NEW FEATURES

oFrugal failure messages all have FAILCODE numbers and each message has links
to details under <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/dev/*SOMETHING*>.
