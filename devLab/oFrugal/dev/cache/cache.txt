  *    cache\ is the location for a cache of compiled oMiser *.obj files  *
  *    files and a setup confirmation file for demonstrating successful   *
  *    compilation.  It is also the location for a cache of compiled      *
  *    raylib *.obj files that can be used as a library in building       *
  *    oFrugal without taking the time to compile them every time.        *
  *                                                                       *
  *    If oFrugal is re-extracted or is updated and extracted, this       *
  *    file and all other files of the new manifest will be replaced. If  *
  *    any current *.opt files have been altered by the user, they should *
  *    first be renamed for protection againsst being over-written.  Then *
  *    use those for review and adjustment of the restored/updated        *
  *    versions.                                                          *
  *                                                                       *
  *  CRITICAL IMPORTANCE.  Rebuild the cache (using mkOFrugal option "-c")*
  *    every time the oMiser\ folder is populated or updated.  If this is *
  *    not done, there is risk that oMiser\src\ header files accessed in  *
  *    the project will not be compatible with the *.obj files in the     *
  *    cache.                                                             *
  *                                                                       *

    cache/ contains compilation materials, setup confirmation programs, and
    compiled oMiser files that become a pre-compiled library to the project.

    When the cache has been populated with compiled oMiser code, new oFrugal
    compiles will avoid the time it would take to compile that code again.

    Using a cache in this manner, with the applicable compilation *.opt files,
    ensures that the compiled oMiser *.obj files and the oFrugal files
    are always compatible.

    IMPORTANT DEPENDENCY: The mkOFrugal.bat file (in the folder above cache/)
    and the option files oMiserCode-x.y.z.opt and VCoptions.opt all depend on
    relative location of an oMiser/ source-code folder.  The use of relative
    addresses also requires that oFrugal/ be installed on the same drive as
    the oMiser/ release code.

    For more information, see <tbd>.

    For details of the *.opt files and how they are employed with mkOFrugal
    see <tbd>.

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates and other ephemeral files
        from any git commits.

    oMiserLinking.opt
        Parameters for linking the compiled oFrugal app and the cache of
        oMiser *.obj files into an .exe program in app\.

    oMiserCode.opt
        Ephemerial file chosen depending on the version of oMiser that is to
        be cached.

    oMiserCode.0.0.0.opt
        Option file to be copied to oMiserCode.opt when using an acceptable
        oMiser-0.0.0 release.

    raylibCode.4.x.0.opt
        Option file copied to raylibCode.opt when using an acceptable
        raylib-4.x or raylib-4.x-dev.

    oMiserVars.opt
        Preprocessor definitions for the compilation of the raylib modules

    VCoptions.opt
        Compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe.
        These options are the same between cache\ and app\ compiles.  This
        file also depends on oMiser\ being in the same predictable relative
        location as relied on in oMiserCode.opt.

    *.obj (after compilation of cached oMiser components)
        VC/C++ compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        raylib files identified in raylibCode.opt.
