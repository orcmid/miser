                          The Miser Project Code

                  BUILDING THE OFRUGAL REPL APPLICATION

  *    cache\ is the location for a cache of compiled oMiser *.obj files  *
  *    files and any setup confirmation file for demonstrating successful *
  *    compilation.  The .obj files can be used as a library in building  *
  *    oFrugal without taking the time to compile oMiser every time.      *
  *                                                                       *
  *  CRITICAL IMPORTANCE.  Rebuild the cache (using mkOFrugal option "-c")*
  *    every time the oMiser\ folder is populated or updated.  If this is *
  *    not done, there is risk that oMiser\src\ header files accessed in  *
  *    the project will not be compatible with the *.obj files in the     *
  *    cache.                                                             *
  *                                                                       *

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates and other ephemeral files
        from any git commits.

    oMiserLinking.opt (pending)
        Parameters for linking the compiled oFrugal app and the cache of
        oMiser *.obj files into an .exe program in app\.

    oMiserCode.opt
        selection of the oMiserCode to be compiled into the cache

    VCoptions.opt
        Compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe.
        These options are the same between cache\ and app\ compiles.  This
        file also depends on oMiser\ being in the same predictable relative
        location as relied on in oMiserCode.opt.

    *.obj (after compilation of cached oMiser components)
        VC/C++ compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        oMiser files identified in oMiserCode.opt.
