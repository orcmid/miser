USAGE WITH VS CODE

    When a project is accessed via Visual Studio Code, the Windows folder
    that contains this .vscode folder should be the current directory.
    VS Code will then rely on configuration properties and variables of the
    Developer Command Prompt to integrate the project with oMiser and with
    the Windows SDK libraries. The benefit is having intellisense for all of
    the project source code, including standard headers and their libraries.

    For additional information on usage of VS Code, see
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211001/>.
