                    OFRUGAL RELEASE 0.0.0 DISTRIBUTION
                    ==================================

  This is about releases of the source-code for the oFrugal REPL.  For
  distribution of executables, consult the Miser Project web pages at
  <https://orcmid.github.io/miser>.  To work with the oFrugal implementation,
  having a GitHub account and accessing <https://orcmid.github.io/miser> is
  preferable.

  *   oFrugal-0.0.0 is not intended for release.  It is a pre-alpha     *
  *   experiment that is intentionally incomplete as part of spiral     *
  *   development between oMiser run-time and its oFrugal REPL          *
  *   implementation.  This and subsquent stages are the least that     *
  *   can possibly work, with low expectations in degress of "work".    *
  *                                                                     *

  *    It is recommended that VS 2022 Version 17.5 or later (including  *
  *    Build Tools) be employed to build oFrugal. There is improved     *
  *    C Language 2011 support assumed in oFrugal source code.          *
  *                                                                     *

  oFrugal is designed to build with versions of Visual Studio that are free
  for personal/open-source use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools
  (recommended) and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels
  of licensed Visual Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools
  Command Prompt.

 PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES

    Exploration and Use of oFrugal source code requires the following tools
    along with confident use of C Language:

     * Windows File Explorer
     * Windows Built-in Zip-Folder Tool
     * Visual Studio Native Build Tools
     * Developer Command Prompt
     * Microsoft VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, CL.exe
     * A text-editor for work on source code, other files, all in plain text
       (Visual Studio Code recommended for its C/C++ and Microsoft support)
     + Git4Win implementation for source-code control
     + TortoiseGit for File Explorer integration of Git
     + GitHub Windows Client for public access to development projects
     + GPG4Win for creation and verification of digital signatures

    The first six are essential.  The remainder are recommended; those are
    not required for starting up.  There are alternatives.  The specific ones
    happen to be those relied upon in the development of the Miser project.
