  *    app\ is the standard subfolder into which oFrugal's .exe           *
  *    executable code is compiled.  app\ is also the location for any    *
  *    accompanying files/folders that must be adjacent to the .exe       *
  *    for correct operation.  This is not expeced for oFrugal.           *
  *                                                                       *
  *    app\ folder content is amenable to delivery in a Zip file after    *
  *    copying to a separate location, removal of extraneous material     *
  *    (such as this file), and addition of supporting content needed     *
  *    for the deployed result.                                           *
  *                                                                       *

MANIFEST

    app.txt
        this synopsis and manifest (not usually deployed by project)

    .gitignore
        excluding some VCrayApp app\ and compilation results from
        any Git so that modifications here are entirely local.
        (possibly customized or removed, not usually deployed with the app)

    resources\
        here when provided as a neighbor of the compiled .exe file and
        included in the app package (the typical raylib technique).  There
        may be other "assets" here, whether in subfolders or as companion
        files.

    *.exe
        here as the compiled product (deliverable), with the exe name
        specified for compilation with mkOfrugal command.

    *.obj
        files that are only transient here and not part of the app package
        (not to be deployed, usually remaining only if a compile fails)

    Other materials are part of the individual project and untouched by
    mkOFrugal.  They should be preserved and backed-up as needed.
