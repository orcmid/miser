                  BUILDING THE OFRUGAL REPL APPLICATION
                  -------------------------------------

SYNOPSIS

    This folder is for the under-development version of oFrugal.  The under-
    development source code and compilations occur here.  Individual
    distributions/snapshots are also collected here.

    Frozen versions for a release of any kind (alpha, beta, etc.) appear at
    the oFrugal level and also in a web location for direct download and
    employment.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/dev>.

    Versions of oFrugal code in this folder are under development and should
    be considered unstable.  This code should not be used directly except on
    an experimental basis and when participating in development of oFrugal
    itself.

    IMPORTANT: This source-code and build setup expects that a copy of
       oMiser source code is available for incorporation in the oFrugal
       build.  The oMiser source code must be obtained separately.
