TODO

  * Add GitHub Readme.md when ready.
  
  * Provide a little bit more information about what this is and where to
    find more about it.
    
  * Add links to other locations of materials and discussions.
    
  * Introduce oFrugal later when there enough oMiser to talk about.
  
  * Ensure a hierarchical organization that fits the nfoTools construction
    sets pattern.
