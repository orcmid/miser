    logic.txt
        on the use of logics in support of theories.txt, the specific

        applied to Miser itself

        notation with the oFrugal REPL

        account for the theoretical progressions that are the foundation
        for achievement of the oMiser computational model and its
        concrete representations

    truth.txt
        explanation of the use of "truth" in the context of a concrete
        computational model and how it figures in computational interpre-
        tations and abstraction representations

TODO

  * Provide a little bit more information about what this is and where to
    find more about it.

  * Add links to other locations of materials and discussions.

  * Introduce oFrugal later when there is enough oMiser to talk about oFrugal.

  * Ensure a hierarchical organization that fits the nfoTools construction
    sets pattern.

  * Add synopsis.

  * Account for the use of these folder-specific synopsis/manifest text files.

  * Explain the reference implementation(s) and notation(s) as the mainline,
    with mockups for proof-of-concept, demonstrations, and exercises.

  * Link to Golden Geek and to Numbering Peano, noting restoration of blogging
    and the web site.

  * Use the logo and the block diagram (on Golden Geek) for a summary of this.
    Don't go into the extensive detail.

  * Docs will continue to be at miser-theory.info, as tempting and convenient
    GitHub might be.  [dh:2018-01-20: Attempting to use docs/ here along
    with the GitHub support for wikis and documentation pages.]

  * There need to be static places of preservation of this project, including
    authenticated distributions, just as being worked on for nfoTools.

  * Explore using GitHub for Pages (docs/), maybe blogging.

  * See how to get a Wiki working here too.  I am concerned mainly about
    reflow and getting pages to work properly.  There is frustration between
    using GitHub versus Blogger at the moment.  The GitHub support is more
    desirable if view reflow works.  It seems to in the Wiki theme.

  * Upload the Miser diagram as the Social Preview under GitHub Settings.

  * Review the efficacy of the various text files.  This may be too much
    subdivision.  Documentation might address this better.  Those files/topics
    might move accordingly.

  * Add attribution statement.

  * Account for the use of .md as well as .txt files in this project.

  * Do we need engineering of the GitHub project (and document engineering)
    as distinct from the engineering of implementations

  * Make the global change of orcmid repositories to have main as the default
    branch name, deprecating master (which will presumably redirect to main).

  * When deep links to https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/main/ work,
    replace the permalink on this page and in any attribution statement
    to employ that absolute path.

  * systematically apply this change to all .txt and .md files in the current
    level.

  * systematically extend the changes into all subfolders of this project,
    expanding breadth first.

  * Review for changes needed in blog, wiki, and documentation pages.

  * For new text, use main as soon as it is workable.
