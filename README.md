# The Miser Project

The Miser Project provides an operational demonstration of
the features, especially the stored-program concept, that make computers so
powerful for practical purposes.  The overall approach and its application of
mathematical-logic are described at the
[Miser Project](https://orcmid.github.io/miser) web site, published as GitHub
Pages from the [docs/](docs/) folder here.

## Current Technical Materials (2023-08-19)

There is no active code development at this stage.  There are some prototype
tests and demonstrations using Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ).  They are
running behind the formal specification at the moment.

Miser Project conception and precursors to development of code are
organized in folders of text files, images, and the prototype code.  The
extensive usage of `*.txt`
files is for explaining the effort to myself, leading up to polished
explanations, experiments, and running code later on.

The organization of folders is here in the
[Orcmid Miser repository](https://github.com/orcmid/miser).  Each
folder has a text file of the same name (e.g., `miser.txt`).  These provide
some technical information and also a manifest for their content, including
subfolders (having their own-named `.txt` files, etc.). Most materials
are in text files spread around the repository in this manner.

Additional text files in various folders provide the technical (rather than
organizational) content.  Some remain aspirational place-holders, others are
under active development, such as some in [oMiser](oMiser/) and
[oFrugal](oFrugal/)

The most-current fleshed-out materials are in the folder
[oMiser](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/tree/master/oMiser).

Details of the conceptualization and its progression are reflected in project
text files (e.g. [miser.txt](miser.txt), [oMiser.txt](oMiser/oMiser.txt),
[obtheory.txt](oMiser/obtheory.txt)) and in dialogue captured in
[Issue pages](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/issues) and
[Discussion pages](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/discussions).

[Polished documentation](https://orcmid.github.io/miser/) will accumulate
as development cycles progress.  That documentation is being authored as
GitHub Pages in the [docs](docs/) folder. A
[wiki](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/wiki) and a Discord server may
become handy, depending on interest in the project.

## Refactoring/Preservation Underway

Some reorganization is necessary in order to continue smoothly.

Meanwhile, there is some information at
[Miser Theory](https://miser-theory.info) until useful/historical content is
transposed to this GitHub site.

Descriptive information of the foundation conception is also available in
blog articles commencing with
[Hark! Is That a Theory I see Before Me?](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/07/miser-project-hark-is-that-theory-i-see.html).

Discussion about the Miser Project is welcome at the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in the code and documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/issues).  There are also
relevant [projects](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/projects?type=classic)
from time to time.
