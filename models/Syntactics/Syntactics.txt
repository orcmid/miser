TODO

  * Find good reference on BNF and its ALGOL-memorializtion.

  * Include the Interpretation formalism and its connection with attribute
    grammars.

  * Tie in with diagnostics and the idea of not producing the result until
    the syntax of an input has been verified.  This might spin out into
    an engineering topic.

  * Find a good character set and character-codes approach, perhaps following
    one of the IETF/ISO specifications.

  * Review the current ob-exp.txt to see what should be captured and
    accounted for.

  * One does need something about Chomsky's Context-Free Grammars too, and
    maybe what the inspiration was with respect to ALGOL 60 and the 1960s
    notion of syntax-directed parsing and compiling of programming languages.

  * There may be a problem with this folder.  It is capturing and preserving
    some images used in various places.  We also want to be able to speak of
    different things, including things such as the precedence rules for
    parsing ob-exp input, and also pretty-printing output of ob-exp forms.
    These all seem to be about grammar schemes as background generally and
    also specifically for oFrugal.

  * Keep in mind that all of this does not go on this page.  There will be
    additional files on these topics (e.g., BNF.txt, precedence.txt,
    parsing.txt, prettyprint.txt), etc.

  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint> Does not go back far enough
    to Landin and also to Oppen (?) or whoever produced the one that I
    converted to doing the job on Fortran programs.

  * Paulsen gives [Oppen1980] as the source.  That is what I used and wrote
    to Oppen about it.  Oppen, D.C.  Pretty Printing. ACM TOPLAS 2, 465-483.

       this topic and folder.
