TODO
 
  * Find good reference on BNF and its ALGOL-memorializtion.
  
  * Include the Interpretation formalism and its connection with attribute
    grammars.
  
  * Tie in with diagnostics and the idea of not producing the result until
    the syntax of an input has been verified.  This might spin out into
    an engineering topic.
