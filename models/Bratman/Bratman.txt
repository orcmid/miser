                                BRATMAN DIAGRAMS
                                ----------------
                                
    Bratman diagrams are employed to illustrate the process nature of 
    computation and how that is layered to produce higher-level activities
    such as transformation of procedures expressed in programming languages
    to programs for computational procedures.  
    
    The original Bratman approach is enriched to provide diagrammatic depiction
    of the bridge to abstractions that are manifest by the choreographed
    computer operation.
      
                                  "A computational process ... cannot be seen
                                  or touched.  It is not composed of matter at
                                  all.  However, it is very real."
                                  
                                  -- Abelson and Sussman, Structure and 
                                     Interpretation of Computer Programs,
                                     p.1.

       five paragraphs of Chapter 1 are very much in the spirit that the
       Miser Project is intended to celebrate.  Focused on an essentially-
       applicative operation, oMiser is more elementary than LISP and the
       Scheme dialect used in SICP,

TODO
 
  * Complete the build-up to Bratman diagrams for illustrating the changes
    of abstraction that programming involves.
  
  * Connect to Golden Geek, Numbering Peano, and TROSTing materials as
    they become available.
