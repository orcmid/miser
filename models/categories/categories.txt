TODO

  * Move the interpretation diagram here from mockups.txt

  * Introduce the repaired diagram here

  * Introduce the representation diagram here also.

  * Emphasize the informality and keeping it simple without the intricacies
    of category theory, available for separate investigation but not crucial
    for demonstration of the computational model.

  * Add attribution statement.
