TODO

  * Introduce the representation diagram here also.

  * Get to Manifestation.

  * Introduce ontological commitment in the reconciliation of interpretation,
    representation, and manifestation.  Identify affordance in the matter.
    See Issue #16 discussion related to this.  Emphasize the contribution of
    William L. Anderson in the discussion leading to and clarifying the idea
    of ontological commitment.  Contrast with the notion of "paradigm."

  * Emphasize the informality and keeping it simple without the intricacies
    of category theory, available for separate investigation but not crucial
    for demonstration of the computational model.

  * Not just turtles all the way down, it is turtles everywhere.

  * Add connections to category theory.

  * There might need to be some smoothing of boole.txt around awkwardness
    and the choice of representation.
