       FRUGALESE GRAMMAR FOR DISPLAYING CANONICAL OBS IN OB-EXP FORM
       -------------------------------------------------------------

    obstring is the string expression of obs that exploits the right-
    associativity of "::" to eliminate unnecessary parentheses.  This
    is, apart from the presence of white space, a unique ob-exp for
    every Canonical Ob.

    The grammar satisfied by the string is essentially ob-exp without
    anything that involves an application in its interpretation.

 1. SUMMARY GRAMMAR

    Here is the reduced summary grammar for the Canonical Obs.  Any
    of these forms are suitable.  Reducing the use of parentheses is
    handled in the procedure for expressing such obs.

    〈term〉 ::= 〈lindy〉 | 〈primitive〉

    〈unary〉 ::= 〈term〉 | ( 〈canonical〉 ) | ‵ 〈unary〉

    〈binary〉 ::= 〈unary〉 | 〈unary〉 :: 〈binary〉

    〈canonical〉 ::= 〈binary〉

 2. SIMPLE EXPRESSION

    Using SML/NJ, the expression of an ob, x, is as follows:

    fun term(x: ob)
      = case x
          of L(s) => s
           | NIL => ".NIL"
           | A => ".A"
           | B => ".B"
           | C => ".C"
           | E => ".E"
           | D => ".D"
           | SELF => ".SELF"
           | ARG => ".ARG"
           | EV => ".EV"
           | _ => "?!"

    fun canonical(x: ob)
      = let fun unary(x)
            = if is_individual(x)
              then term(x)
              else if is_singleton(x)
                   then "`" ^ unary(a x)
                        (* XXX: Using back-tick here *)
                   else "( " ^ canonical(x) ^ " )"
         in if is_pair(x)
            then unary(a x) ^ " :: " ^ canonical(b x)
            else unary(x)
        end;


    To avoid console Unicode limitations/difficulties, the back-tick (grave
    accent) is used in this procedure.

TODO

  * In practice, we don't want to insert more than one space at
    any point in the ob-exp.  This simple expression avoids that but it
    is more involved when there are more forms.

  * A pretty-print form that uses indentation is a bit trickier.  That
    needs to be done.  Line wraps should be used to honor margins also.

  * When there are extensions, we need applicative expressions for their
    canonical expression.  These are for the application of specific
    extension primitives and they support maintenance of extensional
    identity among all obs.
