                 SML MOCKUP EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS
                 --------------------------------------
              
    Standard SML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) is used for demonstration
    of the essential characteristics of Miser obs and the universal
    computational function on obs.
    
    This demonstration is expedient in several respects.  The
    SML/NJ datatype implementation assures certain correctness
    requirements for obs.  And the SML/NJ REPL (Read-Evaluate-
    Print Loop) is automatically available for use as a test
    harness and front end.

TODO

  * Add tutorials\tutorials.txt for the tutorials folder.
    
  * Use obtest to contrast confirmation by computation and the abstract
    mathematical conditions that must not be contradicted.
