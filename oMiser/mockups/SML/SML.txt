                 SML MOCKUP EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS
                 --------------------------------------
              
    Standard SML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) is used for demonstration
    of the essential characteristics of Miser obs and the universal
    computational function on obs.
    
    This demonstration is expedient in several respects.  The
    SML/NJ datatype implementation assures certain correctness
    requirements for obs.  And the SML/NJ REPL (Read-Evaluate-
    Print Loop) is automatically available for use as a test
    harness and front end.

 tutorials/  
          subfolder of tutorial materials supporting the SML
          mockups
        
        ob.sml
           Definitions of the datatype and functions that manifest
           the structure <ob>.
           
     obadt.sml
           Variation that employs the SML/NJ signature and structure
           features to fully encapsulate the primitive notions.
        
   obcheck.sml 
           Test script that connects the abstract data type's
           mathematical characterization and manifestation via
           the SML/NJ ob.sml representation.
           
   obadtcheck.sml
           Comparable test script against the SML Abstract Data Type
           as manifest via obadt.sml.

TODO
     
  * Account for the challenge of avoiding forward references and preservation
    of identity conditions for preservation of quasi-Platonism under
    decentralized, distributed operation.  (Is
    this a form of referential integrity?)
    
  * Introduce literals so that it is possible to see what we are doing
    and also demonstrate some things about representation in the absence
    of valuable types (such as strings), even though we will not get
    any farther until types can work, perhaps beyond the oMiser level.
    
  * Address the run-time exception problem, especially as it will hit us
    with respect to strong typing.
    
  * Look at the non-irreversible architectual change consideration here
    around typing and also the distribution mechanism.
    
  * Account for oMiser as a performance case within a broader set or
    hierarchy of richer (not just sugar) arrangements in which the
    oMiser level is distinguished.  (So there are higher-level forms
    of apply and eval above and beyond ob.ap and ob.ev.)
    
  * Raise the fact that, with oMiser, so long as well-definedness is
    maintained, the application of an individual can involve what would
    be side-effects except they are never revealed.  This includes
    caching of things, too.
    
  * The oFrugal arrangement is about hosting.  Hold onto that notion.
  
  * Add license to obcheck.sml and obadtcheck.sml when the narration is
    completed.

 0.0.8 2017-09-05-21:19 Add obadtcheck.sml for counterpart checking of the
       obadt.sml computational abstract data type manifestation.
 0.0.7 2017-09-05-18:16 Add obadt.sml for the SML/NJ form of encapsulation.
 0.0.6 2017-08-30-12:53 Rename obtest.sml to obcheck.sml and add simple
       confirmation checks corresponding to obtheory Ob1-Ob8
 0.0.5 2017-08-27-15:48 Make ob.sml an interpretation of obtheory and have
       that be explicit in the ob.sml file now.  Refactor so that obtest
       is now just for informally-argued confirmation of the interpretation.
 0.0.4 2017-08-23-10:08 Remove accomplished TODOs, add need to extract and
       elevate the <ob> miser-theory for the Ob set.
 0.0.3 2017-08-19-12:11 Add TODOs and advancing treatment of the
       SML/NJ manifestation as a model of the theoretical <ob> structure.
 0.0.2 2017-08-06-08:55 Add more work items on goals for what the 
       SML mockup and the mathematical connections are intended to
       demonstrate.
 0.0.1 2017-08-05-19:54 Move tutorial-intended screen captures to a
       tutorials subfolder
 0.0.0 2017-08-04-12:38 Create placeholder and initial job jar for
       oMiser mockup development.
