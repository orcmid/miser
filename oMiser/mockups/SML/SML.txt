                 SML MOCKUP EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS
                 --------------------------------------
              
    Standard SML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) is used for demonstration
    of the essential characteristics of Miser obs and the universal
    computational function on obs.
    
    This demonstration is expedient in several respects.  The
    SML/NJ datatype implementation assures certain correctness
    requirements for obs.  And the SML/NJ REPL (Read-Evaluate-
    Print Loop) is automatically available for use as a test
    harness and front end.

TODO

  * Introduce how the mathematical entities are identified with interpretations
    in the ob.sml definitions.

  * Defer this part until after the business of identification between 
    the mathematical theory and the SML interpretation in ob.sml.
    
    val oMiser_symbol = ob_c(ob_NIL, ob_e(ob_NIL))
                        (* pattern of the oMiser logo diagram at
                           http://miser-theory.info *)
    fun is_ob_good(z)
        =        (z = ob_c(ob_a(z), ob_b(z)) andalso is_ob_pair(z))
          orelse (z = ob_e(ob_a(z)) andalso is_ob_enclosure(z))
          orelse (ob_a(z) = z andalso ob_b(z) = z andalso is_ob_individual(z))
      
    val symbol_ok = is_ob_good(oMiser_symbol) 
                    andalso is_ob_good(ob_a oMiser_symbol)
                    andalso is_ob_good(ob_b oMiser_symbol) 
                    andalso is_ob_good(ob_a (ob_b oMiser_symbol))
                
    (* Here, we claim the datatype and related definitions ... *)
   
  * Use obtest to contrast confirmation by computation and the abstract
    mathematical conditions that must not be contradicted.
    
  * Introduce the constructivity constraints that prevent loops.  This
    will raise some interesting problems when obs can be named and
    how foreward reference is disallowed.  This, along with integrity
    of identification, will be a challenge in the preservation of
    quasi-Platonism under decentralized, distributed operation.  (Is
    this a form of referential integrity?)
    
  * Introduce the initial conversation on identity around individuals,
    including their being well-defined and immutable.
    
  * Introduce literals so that it is possible to see what we are doing
    and also demonstrate some things about representation in the absence
    of valuable types (such as strings), even though we will not get
    any farther until types can work, perhaps beyond the oMiser level.
    
  * Address the run-time exception problem, especially as it will hit us
    with respect to strong typing.
    
  * Look at the non-irreversible architectual change consideration here
    around typing and also the distribution mechanism.
    
  * Account for oMiser as a performance case within a broader set or
    hierarchy of richer (not just sugar) arrangements in which the
    oMiser level is distinguished.  (So there are higher-level forms
    of apply and eval above and beyond ob.ap and ob.ev.)
    
  * Raise the fact that, with oMiser, so long as well-definedness is
    maintained, the application of an individual can involve what would
    be side-effects except they are never revealed.  This includes
    caching of things, too.
    
  * The oFrugal arrangement is about hosting.  Hold onto that notion.
  
  * Add licenses to ob.sml and obtest.sml.
