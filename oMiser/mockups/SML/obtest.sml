                         OMISER <ob> CONFIRMATION IN SML
                         ===============================
                        
   These tests demonstrate how the Standard ML of New Jersey manifestation
   of oMiser obs is faithful to the mathematical conditions that apply
   to obs as mathematical objects.  This fidelity supports the quasi-
   Platonic persistence of the mathematical structure, <ob>.
