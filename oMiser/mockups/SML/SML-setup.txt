     Installation instructions for SML/NJ under Windows
     -------------------------------------------------- 
     We now provide a Microsoft Installer package for SML/NJ. The installer 
     contains a full installation including nearly all optional components. 
     (We only exclude "mlrisc-tools" and "nowhere".) You can choose the 
     installation directory. The default is C:\Program Files\SMLNJ. The bin 
     directory containing the sml command is added to the default PATH, though 
     note that you will need to re-open command windows to see the binding. 
     The SMLNJ_HOME environment variable is also set up to point at the 
     location that SML/NJ was installed. You can either launch the interpreter
     directly from a Start Menu entry or by opening a command prompt and 
     typing "sml".
