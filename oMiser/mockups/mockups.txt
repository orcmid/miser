                OMISER MOCKUP EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS
                -----------------------------------------
              
    Operating oMiser obs as an abstract data type along with a universal 
    computational function on pairs of abstract data is demonstrated using
    existing programming systems that have more-or-less direct means for
    representing new types and functions over those types.  
      
    Efficiency concerns notwithstanding, these mockups provide rapid
    experimentation and demonstration of essential characteristics of
    oMiser implementations.

TODO

  * Encapsulate the datatype and primitive-function definitions in an
    SML library.
    
  * Demonstrate the difference between the formal definition of Obs and
    the chosen universal function and the implementation and testing of
    implementations.
    
  * Make it clear that mockups are not the same as production versions.
    They are more proof-of-concept and maybe pilot implementations, but
    not qualifying as the framework that will be used for spiral development
    of stable, production releases.
