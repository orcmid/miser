                          MISER THEORETICAL CONCEPTION
                          ============================

                           ‹ob› MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE
                           ---------------------------

   The mathematical structure, ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉consists of

           Ob, all of the obs
           Of, all functions on obs
           Ot, the applied-logic theory in which the structure is
               characterized

   Obs are mathematical entities used to demonstrate encoding of data and
   effectively-computable functions on such data. This is the foundation on
   which the oMiser computation model is constructed.

   The appeal of ‹ob› among computational models is how interpretation of obs
   as programs exhibits the stored-program principle and the manner in which
   levels of abstraction become available and useful in general-purpose
   computing.  The Miser Project provides an operational implementation that
   demonstrates shared universality with prominent models recognized as
   Church-Turing Complete.

   An informal overview, with illustrative usage, is found in the file
   <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/ob.txt>.

     1. LOGICAL NOTATION
        Notation for First Order Logic with Equality (FOL=) employed in
        mathematical characterization of ‹ob› as well as of other structures.

     2. PRIMITIVE NOTIONS
        Four functions, together with "=" that are sufficient for expressing
        all Obs, given a set of initial individuals.  All computable
        functions in Of (and decidable predicates) can be expressed in Ot in
        terms of the primitives.

     3. DENUMERABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS
        Constraints on the composition of obs in relationship to other obs
        such that there is a precedence ordering among them.  Conditions on
        the effective representation of functions in Ot are elaborated.
        Canonical forms are established for distinguishing and identifying
        obs.

     4. NOTES AND REFERENCES

1. LOGICAL NOTATION

   For Ot, standard First-Order Logic with Equality (FOL=) is employed
   [Wikipedia2019].  An equational format is used with variables understood
   to be universally quantified over the domain of discourse, Ob.  Set theory
   is not employed.

   Logical aspects of theory Ot are expressed using the following notation.
   We intend truth-value semantics of deductions involving propositions
   expressed in Ot.  Use of notions "true" and "false" is in that sense.

      p ⇔ q read p if-and-only-if q, true when both are true or both
             are false, a kind of logical equality relation

      p ⇒ q read if p then q; when p ⇒ q and p both hold, it is
             deducible that q holds.

      p ∨ q is logical or, true when p and q are not both false

      p ∧ q is logical and, true when p and q are both true

        ¬ p is logical not, true when p is false, false when p is true

      x = y is the identity relationship, with ≠ its negation

      x ¶ y read as x precedes y, an ordering relationship that applies
            over Ob

   Although these can be seen as rules for computation, Ot is a deductive
   theory.  E.g., if it is asserted that p ⇔ q and also ¬ p, deduction
   that ¬ q holds is a logical consequence; if it is asserted that p ⇒ q
   and also p, deduction that q holds is a logical inference.  The law
   of excluded middle holds:  It is the case that ¬(p ∧ ¬p) and also
    ¬(¬p) ⇔ p as well as (p ⇒ q) ⇔ (¬p ∨ q).

2. PRIMITIVE NOTIONS

   Specific predicates and functions are introduced by presentation of their
   characteristics via mathematical conditions that distinguish them.

   Functions ob.a, ob.b, ob.c, ob.e and allied relations are taken
   as given and complete.

   Ob1. Pairs
        z = ob.c(x,y) ⇒ ob.a(z) = x ∧ ob.b(z) = y
        z = ob.c(ob.a(z),ob.b(z)) ⇔ ob.a(z) ≠ z ∧ ob.b(z) ≠ z

   Ob2. Enclosures
        z = ob.e(x) ⇒ ob.a(z) = x ∧ ob.b(z) = z
        z = ob.e(ob.a(z)) ⇔ ob.a(z) ≠ z ∧ ob.b(z) = z

   Ob3. Individuals
        ob.is-individual(z) ⇔ ob.a(z) = z ∧ ob.b(z) = z

   Ob4. Structural Discrimination Predicates
        ob.is-singleton(z) ⇔ ob.b(z) = z.
        ob.is-pair(z) ⇔ ¬ ob.is-singleton(z)
        ob.is-enclosure(z) ⇔ ob.is-singleton(z) ∧ ob.a(z) ≠ z

   Ob5. Totality
        ob.is-individual(z) ∨ ob.is-enclosure(z) ∨ ob.is-pair(z)

        It is a consequence that each ob is exactly one of pair,
        enclosure, or individual and there are no others.
          (ob.is-individual(z) ∧ ¬ ob.is-enclosure(z) ∧ ¬ ob.is-pair(z))
        ∨ (ob.is-enclosure(z) ∧ ¬ ob.is-individual(z) ∧ ¬ ob.is-pair(z))
        ∨ (ob.is-pair(z) ∧ ¬ ob.is-enclosure(z) ∧ ¬ ob.is-individual(z))

   Ob6. Structural Identity
        u = ob.c(v,w) ∧ z = ob.c(x,y)
                   ⇒ (u = z ⇔ v = x ∧ w = y)                  (a)

        u = ob.e(v) ∧ z = ob.e(x)
                   ⇒ (u = z ⇔ v = x)                          (b)

        ob.is-pair(u) ∧ ob.is-singleton(z)
                   ⇒ u ≠ z                                     (c)

        ob.is-individual(u) ∧ ob.a(z) ≠ z
                   ⇒ u ≠ z                                     (d)

   Ob7. Identity Among Primitive Individuals
        ob.is-individual(ob.NIL)

        There are a limited number of fixed-name primitive individuals.
        They can be taken as given.  They are not definable in terms of
        others.

        Individuals identified by upper-case namings, such as ob.NIL,
        are distinct if and only if their names differ.  Those
        individuals are also distinct from individuals of any other
        kind that may arise.

3. DENUMERABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS

   Ob8. The ¶ Precedence Condition

        ¬ (x ¶ x)                               (a), irreflexive
        (x ¶ y) ⇒ ¬ (y ¶ x)                     (b), asymmetrical
        (x ¶ y) ∧ (y ¶ z) ⇒ (x ¶ z)             (c), transitive

        x = y ∨ x ¶ y ∨ y ¶ x                    (d), distinction
        x = y ⇔ ¬ (x ¶ y ∨ y ¶ x)

        z = ob.e(y) ⇒ (y ¶ z)                    (e), construction
        z = ob.c(x,y) ⇒ (x ¶ z) ∧ (y ¶ z)

        ob.is-individual(x) ⇒ x ¶ ob.e(x)        (f), floating
        ob.is-individual(x) ⇒ x ¶ ob.c(x,y)
        ob.is-individual(x) ⇒ x ¶ ob.c(y,x)

   Ob9. Denumerable Canonical Form

        Ob consists of all distinct, finitely-expressible obs satisfying
        conditions Ob1-Ob8 and expressed without use of variables and
        without any functions other than ob.c and ob.e, and without any
        extraneous parentheses.  Such expressions are canonical forms in
        that each form is unique to a particular ob and every ob is
        determined via a canonical form.

        Ob is unbounded and denumerable provided that the individuals be
        denumerable.  This is the case for the canonical forms, and the obs
        are in one-to-one correspondence with their canonical forms.

        We say that an ob is definite, or determined, when its canonical form
        can be exhibited explicitly.

        This case is important because computation, for oMiser, can be viewed
        as systematic determination of obs from given definite ones.  This
        contrasts with the Ot characterizations of functions via patterned
        specifications employing variables that assert conditions over ‹ob›
        entire.  This is comparable to the situation with arithmetic where
        decimal numerals are typical canonical forms for (natural) numbers.

        Certain extensions to ‹ob› will augment the variety of canonical forms
        without ever altering the denumerability of them, preserving Ob7-Ob9.

   Ob10. Effectively-Computable Functions in Of

        Without addressing fine technicalities here, a function F over Ob (and
        in Of by definition) is claimed to be effectively-computable if, given
        definite obs as arguments, any definite result is determined by
        deduction based entirely on an Ot characterization of F in a finite
        number of mathematical statements.  It can be the case that there is
        no definite result for some definite arguments.

        Predicates in Ot are effectively-computable as true or false
        in a similar manner and termed effectively-decidable.

        Observe that ob.a(x), ob.b(x), ob.c(x,y), ob.e(x), the four ob.is-...
        predicates, and the "=" relation are all effectively-computable in
        this sense.  They are also total in the sense that a result is
        determined whenever there are definite arguments.

        In contrast, x ¶ y is only partially-determined.  When x ≠ y is
        determined, it need not be deducible which of x ¶ y or y ¶ x holds.
        This is the case among definite individuals that are distinguished
        by literal identifiers and no other condition on comparability.  The
        strength of Ob8 is that ¬(x ¶ x) be preserved.  The mathematical
        benefit of the strict partial-ordering x ¶ y is the availability of
        structural induction for deductions about functions in Of.

        Later, when we make computational interpretations of ‹ob›, there'll
        be no need for an explicit counterpart of x ¶ y.  It is sufficient
        that no ob interpretation can appear as a component within its own
        composition, however deeply, and supporting operations cannot violate
        that constraint.  In valid computational interpretations, counter-
        parts of obs are immutable and have no cycles, the special case of
        singletons notwithstanding.

4. NOTES AND REFERENCES

   The notions of individual, enclosure, singleton, and pair have their
   inspiration in the nested-array work of [More1979] and the foundation
   structure of LISP [McCarthy1960].  The importance of enclosure as a
   structural feature of obs was observed in an incompleteness regarding
   nested strings in [Strachey1965].  Representations of strings that have
   other strings as their beads was also introduced by Doug Ross and
   colleagues in the AED-0 system. The computational model founded on ‹ob›
   for oMiser is a fully-applicative scheme inspired through my association
   with Peter Landin and William H. Burge in the mid-1960s, with operation
   now via a list-processing adaptation of [Strachey1965].

   "Effectively computable" and "effective computability" are used in the
   manner of the title of [Rogers1987].  Identification, for now, with a kind
   of deduction separate from computational interpretations (e.g., as
   algorithms) is meant as a case of effective calculability, the term
   employed in [Church1936] before a general-purpose digital computer had
   ever been seen or described.  For the Miser Project, we do not confine
   computability to Turing Computability, despite demonstrable equivalence.

   When we speak of all of the effectively-computable functions on obs, as
   obs are characterized here, the claim will be that the totality of them is
   equivalent to the CT-computable (total) functions.  When a universal
   function is also formulated, correspondence to a Universal Turing Machine
   and hence Church-Turing Completeness will be claimed.  These stages will be
   demonstrated in later progressions of these Miser Project notes.

   Ob7-Ob9 must be augmented in the case of extensions that introduce new
   distinct individuals constructed from other obs.  Supplementary
   definitions will be provided along with the introduction of such
   extensions.

 0.0.23 2017-12-27-10:45 Touch-up, especially in Ob8-Ob10.  Review TODOs.
 0.0.22 2017-11-23-14:44 Replace ^ with ∧ in a couple of places.  Touch up
        Ob9-Ob10 to make canonical form relevant to computation and leave
        open the prospect of effectively-computable partial functions.
 0.0.21 2017-11-12-09:58 Manage TODOs.  Touch up the text.
 0.0.20 2017-11-11-11:28 Cleanup Ob10 on Effective Computability.
 0.0.19 2017-09-28-13:04  Adjust TODOs.  Address some comments and suggestions
        from Paul McJones (private communication).
 0.0.18 2017-09-17-11:22 Describe ¶ as asymmetrical rather than
        non-commutative (hat tip to Paul McJones).  Expand Ob10 for improved
        informal treatment of representation for effectively-computable
        functions.
 0.0.17 2017-09-14-18:49 Add Ob10 on effective computability.
 0.0.16 2017-09-06-18:02 Correct the GitHub link and add work items about
        further steps.
 0.0.15 2017-09-05-18:11 Make ob.NIL an individual explicitly and simplify
        Ob7 somewhat.
 0.0.14 2017-09-03-09:38 Make the Ob5 Totality partitioning consequence
        formally-explicit.
 0.0.13 2017-08-28-08:56 Touch-up and add TODO about well-definedness.
 0.0.12 2017-08-27-11:43 Wordsmithing and assertion of classical conditions.
 0.0.11 2017-08-26-09:56 Smooth the description of the logical notation and
        distinguish it from similar-appearing computational operations.
 0.0.10 2017-08-24-10:17 Adapted from the SML mockup obtest.sml 0.0.9 for
        reference in all mockups and the expanded development for oMiser.
