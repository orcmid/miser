     INTERPRETATION OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS IN THE ‹ob› MODEL OF COMPUTATION
     -------------------------------------------------------------------

        Boolean Algebras have rich application in connection with digital computation.

        For oMiser, we exhibit enough Boolean Algebra to illuminate important
        features of representation and interpretation of mathematical
        structures in ‹ob› as computational-interpretation intermediary.

 1. MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES

    We introduce two mathematical structures.

    ‹ba› = 〈Ba,Baf,Bat〉
    ‹bp› = 〈Bp,Bpf,Bpt〉

    The logical theories Bpt and Bat are applications of First Order Logic with = (FOL=) and the notation introduced in Section 1 of obtheory.txt,
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obtheory.txt>.

 1.1 Notation and Basic Operations

    The ‹bp› domain of discourse, Bp, consists of exactly two distinguished entities.

       ⊤ (nickname "top")
       ⊥ (nickname "bot")

    The ‹ba› domain of discourse, Ba, is a finite set having at least two distinct members, two of which are distinguished as ⊤ and ⊥, respectively.

    The additional basic notions consist of a small number of functions
    typically expressed as operations.

        ~ x  "comp" x, signifies the complement of x

      x ∩ y  x "cap" y also known as the meet of x and y

      x ∪ y  x "cup" y also known as the join of x and y

      x ∸ y  x "sep" y is x ∪ y excluding x ∩ y, also known as the symmetric
             difference, that which is separate between x and y, if anything.

    In addition to equality, there is also an ordering relation,

      x ⊆ y  x "sub" y, comparable to the subset relation among sets.

    To simplify expressions and reduce parentheses, the above listing is
    taken as an order of precedence, from strongest to weakest.  That is

        x ∩ ~ y ∪ ~ x ∩ y = (x ∩ (~ y) ∪ ((~ x) ∩ y)

 1.2 Basic Constraints

    The basic conditions on all ‹ba› structures are presented in terms of
    axioms, arrangements that hold whatever the domain of discourse, Ba,
    happens to be and however the operations are defined in satisfaction
    of these constraints.

    Ba1. Commutativity
         x ∪ y = y ∪ x
         x ∩ y = y ∩ x

    Ba2. Identity
         x ∪ ⊥ = x
         x ∩ ⊤ = x

    Ba3. Distributivity
         x ∪ (y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y) ∩ (x ∪ z)
         x ∩ (y ∪ z) = (x ∩ y) ∪ (x ∩ z)

    Ba4. Complements
         x ∪ ~ x = ⊤
         x ∩ ~ x = ⊥

    Ba5. Subordination
         x ⊆ y ⇔ x = x ∩ y

 1.3 Additional Characteristics

    The following are consequences of the basic constraints.  They are
    consequences for any Boolean Algebra structure ‹ba› with distinguished
    domain Ba and definite basic operations.

    Ba6. Associativity
         x ∪ (y ∪ z) = (x ∪ y) ∪ z
         x ∩ (y ∩ z) = (x ∩ y) ∩ z

    Ba7. Absorption
         x ∪ (x ∩ y) = x
         x ∩ (x ∪ y) = x

    Ba8. Unique Complement Pairs
         x = ~ ~ x
         x ≠ ~ x

    Ba9. Separation (definition)
         x ∸ y = x ∩ ~ y ∪ ~ x ∩ y

    Ba10. Well-Ordering
         ⊥ ⊆ y (hence "bot")
         x ⊆ ⊤ (hence "top")

    Ba11. The number of members in the domain of discourse Ba is even and a
         power of 2.

 1.4 Interpretations

    The structures, ‹ba› and the special case ‹bp› are highly abstract.
    The only requirement for representing any ‹ba› is to distinguish the
    (finitely) enumerable members of the domain of discourse in some manner;
    then represent the basic functions such that all of the basic conditions
    are satisfied.


 2. ‹bp› REPRESENTATION

 2.1 Unique Representation

    Given definite Bp = {⊥, ⊤}, the basic constraints are uniquelly satisfied
    by the functions represented as bp.comp, bp.meet, bp.join, etc.

    bp.comp(⊥) = ⊤
    bp.comp(⊤) = ⊥

    bp.meet(⊤, ⊤) = ⊤
    bp.meet(⊥, x) = ⊥
    bp.meet(⊤, ⊥) = ⊥

    bp.join(⊤, x) = ⊤
    bp.join(⊥, x) = x

    bp.sep(⊤, x) = bp.comp(x)
    bp.sep(⊥, x) = y

    bp.sub(⊤, ⊤)
    bp.sub(⊥, x)

 2.2 Notable Qualities

     * Verification of a computational interpretation of Ba1-Ba10 by
       exhaustive testing is feasible.

     * All computable functions, bp.f(x1, x2, ..., xn) in Bpf are
       representable via Bpt using only bp.comp, bp.meet, and bp.join operations.

     * Propositions of the form bp.f(x1, x2, ..., xn) = ⊤ correspond to
       propositional logic assertions s(p1, p2, ..., pn) by rewriting the representation of bp.f such that ~ x becomes ¬ p, x ∩ y becomes p ∧ q,
       x ∪ y becomes p ∨ q, and x ∸ y becomes ¬ (p ⇔ q), the latter also
       known as exclusive-or.

     * The form bp.f(x1, x2, .., xn) is satisfiable if there is an assignment
       of {⊥, ⊤} values to the xi such that bp.f(x1, x2, .., xn) = ⊤.  The
       determination of satisfiability from the representation of bp.f can
       grow exponentially in the worst case as the number of variables increases.  That the worst case cannot be improved figures in an
       important conjecture (P ≠ NP) concerning computational complexity.

2.3 ‹bp› Interpretation in ‹ob›




 ?. NOTES AND REFERENCES

    Limitation of ‹ba› to a domain of discourse having at least two members
    and being finite is appropriate for consideration of computational
    interpretations under oMiser.  Although there are Boolean Algebras having
    unbounded domains, that is not considered here.

    Formulation of ‹ba› is an amalgam of the various treatments cited below.
    Symbols ⊤ and ⊥ are are chosen to avoid the common use of 1 and 0 and
    confusion with interpretation as numbers and binary bits, despite the
    historical roots in [Boole1834] and the practical application to binary
    representations in digital computing [Knuth2011].

    Likewise, the symbols for Boolean operations are kept distinct from the
    logical connectives used throughout oMiser in FOL= notation, hence the
    use of complement, meet, join, and sep symbols.  Notation separation
    facilitates recognition of correspondence without suggestion of identity.

 TODO:

  * Interpret ‹bp› in ‹ob›.  Characterize as an implementation.

  * Deal with the partiality of ‹bp› interpretation and the restriction.
    Also the arbitrariness of the interpretations of ⊤ ⊥.

  * Establish ‹ba› and see what we need to differ with respect to ‹bp›.

  * Interpret ‹bp› as a restriction of ‹ba›.

  * Find out if ⊤ ⊥ are legitimate lindies or not.  It might be best that
    they not be.  (This is a question about Unicode characters and what
    qualifies as alphanumeric.)

  * Well-ordering will be important (?)

  * We will distinguish Interpretation of one structure in another and how
    the interpretation can be an implementation or a simulation.  (terms
    from Forster)

  * Be consistent in the use of qualified names for entities, such that the
    structural context is explicit.

  * At some point, we need to deal with labeling of entities, sequences,
    and class membership.
