                 Sources of further details and theoretical work
                 behind the kind of functional programming that
                 oMiser affords

 1. MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES

    We introduce two mathematical structures.

    ‹ba› = 〈Ba,Baf,Bat〉
    ‹bp› = 〈Bp,Bpf,Bpt〉

    The logical theories Bpt and Bat are applications of First Order Logic with = (FOL=) and the notation introduced in Section 1 of obtheory.txt,
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obtheory.txt>.

 1.1 Notation and Basic Operations

    The ‹bp› domain of discourse, Bp, consists of exactly two distinguished entities.

       ⊤ (nickname "top")
       ⊥ (nickname "bot")

    The ‹ba› domain of discourse, Ba, is a finite set having at least two distinct members, distinguished as ⊤ and ⊥.

    The additional basic notions consist of a small number of functions
    typically expressed as operations.

        ~ x  "comp" x, signifies the complement of x

      x ∩ y  x "cap" y also known as the meet of x and y

      x ∪ y  x "cup" y also known as the join of x and y

      x ∸ y  x "sep" y is x ∪ y excluding x ∩ y, also known as the symmetric
             difference, that which is separate between x and y, if anything.

    In addition to equality, there is also an ordering relation,

      x ⊆ y  x "sub" y, comparable to the subset relation among sets.

    To simplify expressions and reduce parentheses, the above listing is
    taken as an order of precedence, from strongest to weakest.  That is

        x ∩ ~ y ∪ ~ x ∩ y = (x ∩ (~ y) ∪ ((~ x) ∩ y)

 1.2 Basic Conditions

    Ba1. Commutativity
         x ∪ y = y ∪ x
         x ∩ y = y ∩ x

    Ba2. Identity
         x ∪ ⊥ = x
         x ∩ ⊤ = x

    Ba3. Distributivity
         x ∪ (y ∩ z) = (x ∪ y) ∩ (x ∪ z)
         x ∩ (y ∪ z) = (x ∩ y) ∪ (x ∩ z)

    Ba4. Complements
         x ∪ ~ x = ⊤
         x ∩ ~ x = ⊥

    Ba5. Subordination
         x ⊆ y ⇔ x = x ∩ y

 1.3 Additional Characteristics

    The following are consequences of the basic conditions, being applicable
    to any Boolean Algebra structure ‹ba› with distinguished domain of
    discourse and definite basic operations.

    Ba6. Associativity
         x ∪ (y ∪ z) = (x ∪ y) ∪ z
         x ∩ (y ∩ z) = (x ∩ y) ∩ z

    Ba7. Absorption
         x ∪ (x ∩ y) = x
         x ∩ (x ∪ y) = x

    Ba8. Unique Complement Pairs
         x = ~ ~ x
         x ≠ ~ x

    Ba9. Separation (definition)
         x ∸ y = x ∩ ~ y ∪ ~ x ∩ y

    Ba10. Well-Ordering
         ⊥ ⊆ y (hence "bot")
         x ⊆ ⊤ (hence "top")

    Ba11. The number of members in the domain of discourse Ba is even and a
         power of 2.

 1.4 Interpretations

    The structures, ‹ba› and the special case ‹bp› are highly abstract.
    The only requirement for representing any ‹ba› is to distinguish the
    (finitely) enumerable members of the domain of discourse in some manner;
    then represent the basic functions such that all of the basic conditions
    are satisfied.

 2. ‹bp› REPRESENTATION

    bp.comp(⊥) = ⊤
    bp.comp(⊤) = ⊥

    bp.meet(⊤, ⊤) = ⊤
    bp.meet(⊥, x) = ⊥
    bp.meet(⊤, ⊥) = ⊥

    bp.join(⊤, ⊤) = ⊤
    bp.join(⊥, x) = x
    bp.join(⊤, ⊥) = ⊤

    bp.sep(⊤, ⊤) = ⊥
    bp.sep(⊥, x) = x
    bp.sep(⊤, ⊥) = ⊤

    bp.sub(⊤, ⊤) ∧ bp.sub(⊥, x)

 ?. NOTES AND REFERENCES

    Limitation of ‹ba› to a domain of discourse having at least two members
    and being finite is appropriate for consideration of computational
    interpretations unde oMiser.  Although there are Boolean Algebras having
    unbounded domains, that is not considered for ‹ba› here.

    Formulation of ‹ba› is an amalgam of the various treatments cited below.
    Symbols ⊤ and ⊥ are are chosen to avoid the common use of 1 and 0 and
    confusion with interpretation as numbers and binary bits, despite the
    historical roots in [Boole1834] notation.  Likewise, the symbols for
    Boolean operations are kept distinct from the logical connectives used throughout oMiser in FOL= notation, hence the use of complement, meet, and sep symbols instead (contrasting with [Knuth2011]).  The distinct
    notation is intended to facilitate recognition of representations
    and interpretations, emphasizing correspondence without suggesting identity.

 TODO:

  * Interpret ‹bp› in ‹ob›.  Characterize as an implementation.

  * Deal with the partiality of ‹bp› interpretation and the restriction.
    Also the arbitrariness of the interpretations of ⊤ ⊥.

  * Establish ‹ba› and see what we need to differ with respect to ‹bp›.

  * Interpret ‹bp› as a restriction of ‹ba›.

  * Find out if ⊤ ⊥ are legitimate lindies or not.  It might be best that
    they not be.

  * Well-ordering will be important (?)

  * We will distinguish Interpretation of one structure in another and how
    the interpretation can be an implementation or a simulation.  (terms
