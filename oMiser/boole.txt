     INTERPRETATION OF BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS IN THE ‹ob› MODEL OF COMPUTATION

              1. MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES
                 Abstract theories of Boolean Algebras in the manner of
                 obtheory that is at a different level of abstraction.

 TODO:

  * Establish the characters for the expression notations:
    ~ ‹ › ∩ ∪ ⊆ ⊤ ⊥ ⨁ ⨡ ∊

  * Provide the two structures, ‹bp› and ‹ba›.

  * Interpret ‹bp› in ‹ob›.  Characterize as an implementation.

  * Deal with the partiality of ‹bp› interpretation and the restriction.
    Also the arbitrariness of the interpretations of ⊤ ⊥.

  * Establish ‹ba› and see what we need to differ with respect to ‹bp›.

  * Interpret ‹bp› as a restriction of ‹ba›.

  * Find out if ⊤ ⊥ are legitimate lindies or not.  It might be best that
    they not be.

  * Deal with the limitation on powers-of-2 for set Ba.

  * For references use the Elseviere, Wikipedia, Knuth, and Stoll.

  * Well-ordering will be important (?)
