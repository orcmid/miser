      FRUGALESE GRAMMAR FOR EXPRESSING THE OMISER COMPUTATION OF OBS
      --------------------------------------------------------------

    Ob-exp texts are used as a means of specifying obs and computations
    with them to derive an ob result.  Ob-exp is an expression language
    that is used in digital communication of computations with obs and
    also used to submit expressions for oMiser computation via oFrugal.

    ob-exp has a context-free grammar, here specified using the original
    Backus-Naur Form (BNF) employed in the Revised Report on the
    Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60.  The grammar specifies exactly those
    expressions that can be evaluated to (at most) a single ob when submitted
    to a processor such as an oFrugal implememtation.

    In addition to the grammatical structure for composing ob-exp
    expressions, there is also a formal definition of the computation by
    which an ob-exp is evaluated.

    For an informal introduction to the use of Frugalese in the computational
    model defined on the mathematical structure ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉, see
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/ob.txt> and other
    material cited there.

 1. SUMMARY GRAMMAR

    The following summary form of the grammar is useful for reference.
    It does not address the grammatical differences that are called for
    to align with the interpretation rules by which an ob-exp is evaluated.

    All ob-exps satisfy the summary grammar.  The "official" grammar
    rules detailed in subsequent sections employ syntactically-equivalent
    structures in order to provide rigorous interpretation as expressions of
    ob computations.

    The SML form of (* ... *) multi-line comments is allowed and defined
    as white-space.

    The concrete reference syntax consists of Unicode, usually in UTF8
    encoding, and a %-escape mechanism is used when a character is not
    printable.  It is recommended that characters that are not easily typed
    be avoided by authors of ob expressions, recognizing that a recipient
    may encounter %-encoding instead.  If you don't know what this is about,
    you are probably on safe ground.

    Basically, white-space is allowed wherever it does not change the
    grammar of a 〈term〉 and required where consecutive 〈term〉 occurrences
    would not be disambiguated. Using a (* ... *) comment alone for this
    purpose is discouraged but not prohibited.

    For simplicity of keyboarding, the reversed-prime, ‵, left-tick, `, and
    apostrophe, ', are all treated the same.  The reversed-prime is the
    "official" reference character.

    〈term〉 ::= 〈lindy〉 | 〈primitive〉 | 〈binding-name〉

    〈binding-name〉 ::= ^〈lindy〉

    〈primitive〉 ::= .〈lindy〉
                        from a fixed predefined list

    〈lindy〉 is an alphanumeric name not beginning with a digit and without
           spaces, corresponding to an XML NCName without "."


    〈list-terms〉 ::= 〈ob-exp〉 | 〈list-terms〉, 〈ob-exp〉
    〈list-form〉 ::= [ ] | [ 〈list-terms〉 ] | [ 〈list-terms〉 :]

    〈parameters-form〉 ::= ( 〈list-terms〉 ) | 〈list-form〉

    〈function-form〉 ::= 〈term〉 | 〈function-form〉 〈parameters-form〉

    〈obap-form〉 ::= ( 〈ob-exp〉 ) | 〈list-form〉 | 〈obap-form〉 〈parameters-form〉

    〈unary〉 ::= 〈function-form〉 | ‵ 〈obap-form〉 | ‵ 〈unary〉

    〈ae-form〉 ::= 〈unary〉 | 〈unary〉 〈ae-form〉
    〈ae〉 ::= 〈ae-form〉 | 〈obap-form〉 | 〈obap-form〉 〈ae-form〉

    〈binary〉 ::= 〈ae〉 | 〈ae〉 :: 〈binary〉

    〈ob-exp〉 ::= 〈binary〉

 2. EXPRESSION INTERPRETATION

    Interpretation of expressions as obs is accomplished using a special
    schema notation that specifies the ‹ob› theory language, Ot, expression
    that is the interpretation of a given ob-exp text.  The interpretation
    schemas have distinct form.

        I category ⎾pattern⏋(parameter-list) =: interpretation

    where      category is one of the syntactic categories, such as
                        〈ob-exp〉, 〈ae〉, and 〈term〉

                pattern is one of the patterns for the particular category,
                        such as 〈binary〉, 〈obap-form〉 〈ae-form〉, and 〈lindy〉

       (parameter-list) is an optional list of one-or-more parameters

         interpretation is an obaptheory expression schema in which any
                        parameter and I category (parameter-list) forms are
                        in reference to appearances in the pattern

    For example,

        I〈ae〉⎾〈obap-form〉 〈ae-form〉⏋=: obap.ap(I〈obap-form〉,I〈ae-form〉)

    On the right-hand side of the "=:" the category names refer to those
    in the pattern on the left-hand side, and the interpretations of those
    occurrences is called for to determine the individual ob that is the
    evaluation.

    An example employing parameters is found in the section 6 interpretation
    of I〈arguments〉.

    The 〈ob-exp〉 grammar production is designed to allow for additional
    forms beyond 〈binary〉.  None are anticipated at this time.

TODO

 * Find reference to the BNF specification used, captured here somewhere
   and also where formally published.

 * Connect the interpretation schemata to Knuth's attribute grammars to the
   degree that matters here.  There might be a better reference for the
   rather simple oFrugal case.

 * Add the handling of concrete cases and the tie-in to a reference
   character code, akin to the counterpart in the XML specification.

 * Use the XML 1.0 (Namespaces) characterization of white space, letters,
   digits, and the restricted allowance of other characters in ob-exp terms.
   Provide a reference.

 * Use the SML/NJ use of \<white-space>\ as null.

 * Do we require white-space anywhere or is it optional everywhere
   except between two terms that must remain separated?

 * Likewise, at the concrete term level, there is the matter of IRI
   encoding for characters having no available font glyph.  How does
   that work into interchange of concrete ob-exp texts?  Use a rigorous
   IRI case and provide reference to the (latest?) IETF specification on
   the matter.  Masinter, where are you when I need you? :)

 * Complete the production of 〈term〉s and their interpretations.

 * explain the resolution of binding names by the presumption of an
   (oFrugal) environment in which the binding can be resolved.  Complete
   this specification by including the oFrugal REPL statement sequencing.

 * The function for resolving binding names can be expressed in
   oFrugal, but it requires a way to fail when the encountered
   binding name is not bound.  So we need to have a *fail* interpretation
   different from there being an explicit fail in oMiser.  We might
   call it an event, but need to be careful.

 * Incorporate the interpretation of sequences of REPL commands with respect
   to the sequential (and context-free!) interpretation of bindings.

 * Add attribution statement.
