       REPRESENTATION OF COMBINATORS IN THE ‹ob› MODEL OF COMPUTATION
       --------------------------------------------------------------
              
    Combinators are important theoretical objects in theories of computation
    related to the lambda calculus.  Realization of combinators using oMiser
    demonstrates an important form of universality.
    
    To establish an effective representation, it is important to understand
    the theoretical characteristics and how the representation provides 
    faithful interpretations.  An important consideration involves the fact
    that representations are not unique.  There will be many ways to achieve
    representation of the same combinator.  This applies at the theoretical
    level and also at the representation level.

    An important quality of the chosen representations will be the fact that
    oMiser application of combinator representations are all interpretation
    preserving.  This is developed further because it is the avenue to
    consideration of representations of non-combinator operations that are
    composable using combinators.  
    
    The interpretation-preserving composition of combinator forms provide
    a kind of universal expression of functional compositions over particular
    data-type abstractions.  Confirmation of those qualities, and the 
    qualifications that apply, is an important exploration of the oMiser
    computation model.
