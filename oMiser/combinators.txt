       REPRESENTATION OF COMBINATORS IN THE ‹ob› MODEL OF COMPUTATION
       --------------------------------------------------------------
              
    Combinators are important theoretical objects related to the lambda (λ)
    calculus.  Realization of combinators using oMiser demonstrates a form 
    of computational universality: expressing all of the computable functions
    over a given datatype, including ‹ob› and further datatypes represented 
    in ‹ob›.

    The key is having representations of combinators that are interpretation-
    preserving.  That is, they extend directly to combining function-
    representing entities beyond those interpretable as combinators. 

    The challenge is oMiser being a concrete system in which applicative
    interpretation is not a formal matter but a computational procedure 
    that yields a definite ob result, if any, on each obap.ap or obap.eval
    evaluation.  Achievement of combinator representations is required to
    fit that computational apparatus (and visa versa).
    
    Development of oMiser combinator representations proceeds from the theory
    of combinators through demonstration of interpretation-preserving utility.
    This, followed by oMiser representation of combinators, provides a key 
    component in demonstration of oMiser computational universality.

    There is, thereby, exhibition of an important aspect of software
    engineering: successful intended interpretation of other, higher-order
    computational entities via functions over quite different, lower-level
    data structures, bridging between different levels of abstraction.

 1. MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE 

    1.1 Theory of Combinator Arithmetic, ‹ca›

    The account of [Rosenbloom1950] is adapted here.

    C0. For combinators x and y, | x y is the combinator formed by
        application of (operator) x to (operand) y. 
    C1. For combinator x, x ≈ x.
    C2. For combinators x and y, x ≈ y ⇒ y ≈ x.
    C3. For combinators x, y, and z, x ≈ y ∧ y ≈ z ⇒ x ≈ x. 
    C4. For combinators x, y, a, and b, x ≈ y ∧ a ≈ b ⇒ | x a ≈ | y b.
    C5. S and K are combinators.
    C6. For combinators x, y, and z, ||| S x y z ≈ || x z | y z.
    C7. For combinators x and y, || K x y ≈ x.
    CE. For combinators x and y, if | x a ≈ | y a for all combinators, a,
        then x ≈ y.

    The logical notation is that used in obtheory.txt,
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obtheory.txt>.
    
    This is not about ‹ob›.  The combinators are not obs.  Likewise, the
    application, | f x, is an application of combinators that yields
    combinators.  It must not be confused with the obap.ap of obaptheory,
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obaptheory.txt>,
    where application is of the procedure encoded in one ob, as operator, to 
    the operand ob.

    The notation with "|" for application is an useful reminder that this
    application operation is in the realm of combinators.  
    
    It is convenient to omit leading "|" since they can be supplied
    automatically: the total number of "|" must be one less than the number
    of terms in the expression.  We can write

       S x y z for ||| S x y z
       K x y for || K x y
       x z | y z for || x z | y z

    The symbol "≈" is for equivalence of combinators.  This is distinct
    from the "=" equality relationship among obs.  Although "≈" is tantamount
    to an equality in ‹ca›, that interpretation is avoided here.  It is 
    unclear that there are distinguished, unique mathematical entities for any 
    combinator.  We shall skirt the question with "≈", accepting that there
    might be multiple but equivalent concrete interpretations in a 
    computational model of ‹ca› and be content with that.

    1.2 Useful Simple Combinators

    It is known for ‹ca› that all combinators can be expressed in terms
    of combinators S and K alone (with certain reservations concerning
    concrete representation that will be addressed in Section 3).  Some 
    derived combinators are so handy that there are constant names for them. 
    There are also equivalent λ-expressions, shown below.

      S x y z ≈ x z | y z
            S ≈ λx.λy.λz.( (x z)(y z) )

      K x y ≈ x   
          K ≈ λx.λy.x  
    
      I x ≈ x
        I ≈ S K K
          ≈ λx.x

      B f g x ≈ f | g x
            B ≈ S | K S K
              ≈ λf.λg.λx.( f(g x) )

      C f x y ≈ f | y x
            C ≈ S | D S | K K
              ≈ λf.λx.λy.( f(y x) )

      D f x g y ≈ f x | g y
              D ≈ B B
                ≈ λf.λx.λg.λy.( (f x)(g y) )

      T x f ≈ f x
          T ≈ C I
            ≈ λx.λf.( f x )

      W f x ≈ f x x
          W ≈ S S | S K
            ≈ λf.λx.( (f x) x )

    In these λ-expressions there are no combinator "constants" (e.g., S, K, or
    others) and variables in the expressions are ones for which there is an
    outer (preceding) λ form. This closed form of λ-expression is inter-
    changeable with the notation for combinators of (1.1), as demonstrated 
    with the equivalences above.

    Precise rules for using λ-expression forms and reasoning about them are
    complicated by the use of variables.  For a typical explanation, see
    [Révész1988: 2.1].  Detailed descriptions are found on the Internet,
    e.g., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Formal_definition>.
      
    Here, in Miser Project usage, parentheses are retained in (closed) 
    λ-expressions as shown above to avoid any ambiguity in application order
    between typical λ-calculus notations for applicative expressions and the 
    different unparenthesized construction of applications in Frugalese.  See
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/ob-exp.txt>.

    Equivalent λ-expressions make the applicative structure more apparent, 
    easier to express, and suggestive of intermediate forms.  That utility
    will be exploited later by introduction of a computationally-defined
    λ-abstraction as an oMiser script.
    
    1.3 What Combinator Is It?  

    Formally, all we can do is manipulate formulas of combinators in 
    ways that demonstrate two forms are equivalent.  To assess the nature
    of some combinator in achieving a particular applicative arrangement, 
    a simple approach consists of the following:

       * Given some combinator expression having only constants (such as
         B, K, and S) write the expression applied to a succession of 
         variables, a, b, c, ... .  Expand the expression wherever application
         of a combinator constant can be replaced by its equivalent defined
         form.  Stop application to variables once expansion leaves no 
         constants or when that is clearly not achievable.  

       * An expansion can also go no further when not all of the arguments of 
         a defined combinator are available, including when a variable of
         unknown definition is shown as the operator of an application.
         
    For example, given | S K, expand via
         
             S K a b = K b | a b ≈ b.  

    In the case of | S K a b, we see that | S K a b ≈ b ≈ I b, and so by (CE)
    | S K a ≈ I for any combinator, a, including K.

    Consider
                   B I a b  ≈  I | a b  ≈  a b.
    Then              B I a ≈ a ≈ I a
    by (CE), and        B I ≈ I 
    by (CE) as well.

    There is more difficulty determining what combinator | W W W might be.
    Substituting in | W a b ≈ | a b b simply yields | W W W and there is
    no progress to be made.  Additional exotic cases of practical importance
    are addressed in Section 4, below.

    1.4 The Power of Combinators

    Even in ‹ca›, where the only mathematical entities are the combinators, 
    whether expressed in a pure combinatory manner or with closed 
    λ-expressions, it is possible to represent all manner of data and
    operations on such entities.  Such representations are found in 
    [Burge1975], [Révész1988: Chapters 3-4], and [Paulson1996].  [Scott2012], 
    focusing on the λ-calculus view, sketches the variety of constructions and
    connections in mathematical logic and other theoretical mathematical 
    approaches.
      
    Fundamentally, the combinators and equivalent closed λ-expressions are
    all about ways of composing functions from other ones.  Although this
    can be employed indefinitely presuming combinators as the only entities, 
    the capabilities of ‹ca› are also of practical use in composing other
    types of functions, so long as those functions are compatible with the
    combinators applied to them.  
    
    This power is exploited in the concrete representation of combinators via
    oMiser script obs in Section 3.  The bridge is via functional type and
    interpretation-preserving use of combinators and combinator-like entities.

 2. FUNCTIONAL TYPE AND INTERPRETATION PRESERVATION

    Despite ‹ca› having only combinators and application as the only function
    yielding a combinator on application of one combinator (the operator) to
    another combinator (the operand), there is another level of abstractions
    immediately available as a potential interpretation: that of functional 
    types. 

    2.1 Functional Type

    The usual notation for functional type is used here.  We designate type
    variables using Greek letters.  

       x: α
       f: α → β
       
    expresses that x is an entity of type α and f is a function that when 
    applied to an operand of type α yields a result of type β.  The type of
    f is (α → β).  Types can be composed further by substitutions in that
    pattern.

    In these terms, from inspection of the definitions, (1.2), we can infer
    the simplest functional types of well-known combinators as follows

       K x y ≈ x
       x: α
       y: β
       K: α → (β → α)

      S x y z = x z | y z
      z: α
      y: α → β
      x: α → (β → γ)
      S: (α → (β → γ)) → (α → β) → (α → γ)

      I x ≈ x
      x: α
      I: α → α

      B f g x ≈ f | g x
      x: α
      g: α → β
      f: β → γ
      B: (β → γ) → (α → β) → (α → γ)

      C f x y ≈ f | y x
      x: α
      y: α → β
      f: β → γ
      C: (β → γ) → α → (α → β) → γ

      D f x g y ≈ f x | g y
      y: α
      g: α → β
      x: γ
      f: γ → (β → δ)
      D: (γ → (β → δ)) → γ → (α → β) → (α → δ)

      T x f ≈ f x
      x: α
      f: α → β   
      T: α → (α → β) → β

      W f x ≈ f x x
      x: α
      f: α → (α → β)
      W: (α → (α → β)) -> (α → β)  

    2.2 Interpretation Preservation via Functional Type      
       
    Functional types in ‹ca› reveal the extent to which a combinator can be 
    indifferent to the functional interpretation of entities involving various 
    types under the same system of application.  

    The trivial case is when all of the type variables are replaced by the 
    same specific type, whether CA or Ob.

    Combinators taken as interpretation-preserving of functional types, as 
    here, are said to be polymorphic with regard to interpretation of fixed
    types of operands and operators that conform to the variable functional-
    type patterns. 

    2.3 The Avenue to Concrete Interpretations

    For a concrete computational mechanism, such as that for oMiser, one can
    simply substitute Ob for all of the type variables, α, β, γ, δ.  There is
    similarity with ‹ca› in the sense that every ob has interpretation as an 
    (Ob → Ob) type. That does not assure interpretation as a combinator
    under obap.ap, however.

    Having a script, cK interpretable as combinator K, it must be the case
    that, in oFrugalese notation,

      (^cK x) y = x

    so if x is interpretable as a combinator, that interpretation is 
    preserved just as it is for x interpretable as an entity of any type,
    since it preserves the ob, x, and whatever interpretation that might
    be intended for it.  In this manner, functional type is honored and cK
    interpretation as combinator K is satisfied.

    Likewise, supposing there is a script, cS, such that, in oFrugalese, 

      ((^cS x) y) z = (x z) (y z),  

        ^cS: (α → (β → γ)) → (α → β) → (α → γ)

    works when x, y, and z have interpretation as combinators or as other
    types of entities consistent with the functional type of cS.  It is
    sufficient for cS operation to preserve the interpretations of x, y, and
    z and that those operand interpretations satisfy their role in the
    functional-type pattern (α → (β → γ)) → (α → β) → (α → γ).

    Here there are Ot "=" and definite computational results, yet preserving 
    interpretation with regard to functional type. Representing combinators 
    via scripts that provide interpretation-preserving concrete ob results is 
    sufficient for modeling computational structures.  We can describe this
    condition as quasi-combinatory.

    2.4 Restricted Interpretation as Types

    In ‹ca› there are only combinators and the application operation; in ‹ob› 
    there are only obs, some primitive functions, and other functions on obs
    including application operations obap.ap and obap.eval.  
    
    Within those respective theoretical structures, as given for oMiser, 
    the notion of different functional types and different individual types 
    is a higher level of abstraction based on achievement of intended 
    interpretations, interpretations that are usually not satisfied by all 
    operators and operands with respect to application. E.g, not every ob has 
    interpretation as a combinator.  Similarly, certain interpretations of 
    combinators (e.g., as predicates) do not extend to all ‹ca› combinators.

    For the oMiser representation of ‹ob›, the interpretation of an ob apart
    from being just an ob depends on some characterization that some obs
    satisfy and, presumably, others do not.  

    To manifest a level of abstraction in which the specific functional types
    are satisfied, there must be some restraint to using obs that are computa-
    tional representations of and interpretable as individuals of specific 
    functional types.  Maintaining the semblance involves restraints on the 
    use of the computational entities (e.g., representations via obs) in a 
    manner that orchestrate computational procedures in satisfaction of the 
    restricted interpretation(s).

    In the context of digital computation, the orchestration of available
    types in manifestation of other (higher-order) types is characteristic
    of computer software programming.  There are practices which are employed
    to engineer the layering of abstractions in dependable ways.

      * Preserved interpretations.  Restraints are applied in the design,
        combination, and operation of scripts such that particular representa-
        tions are confirmed to be interpretable as particular types.  For 
        example, the representation of combinators by obs that are used in
        accordance with the related functional types.  The demonstration that
        the abstraction is preserved is usually established externally and 
        with computational tests that confirm satisfaction and preservation
        of particular types.

      * Distinguished interpretations.  Having a computational means to 
        discriminate entities that definitely satisfy a particular interpreta-
        tion from those that are not so distinguished.  This can be used by
        procedures to verify that their operands satisfy the interpretation.

      * Designated interpretations.  Providing some sort of decoration on
        entities that names or annotates the representations themselves.  This
        provides a strict labelling of a type interpretation for an entity.

    Typically, there are many ways to represent entities of some type, and
    it then becomes interesting to deal with (1) the different interpretations
    that a single computational entity might satisfy and (2) inter-operation
    with different representations of the same type.

    We use the oMiser idioms for combinators to launch Miser Project investi-
    gation of levels of computational abstraction and how computational means
    are applicable to manage and confirm representations and satisfaction of
    theoretical interpretations.

 3. oMISER UTILITY COMBINATOR IDIOMS

    3.1 Combinator Representation Constraints

    The conditions on the concrete representation of combinators via obs are

      * The application obap.ap(f,x) of ‹ob› is interpreted as the application
        | f x of ‹ca›, where f and x are interpreted as combinators.

      * The application of an ob interpretable as a combinator is 
        interpretation-preserving and exhibits the same polymorphic functional
        type as the represented combinator.

      * The application of an ob interpretable as a combinator determines a
        definite result in accordance with the combinator's definition.

          o Here, the determination is of ‹ob› equality, "=" with regard to 
            the derivation and its result.

          o There is no counterpart of ‹ca› equivalence, "≈" in ‹ob›.  When
            "≈" is asserted with respect to obs, it is relative to the 
            interpretations.           

          o The relational "f ≅ g" is used to signify that obs f and g, 
            interpreted as operator scripts, are either identical or have the
            same effect when interpreted as functions in ‹ob› having the same
            functional type. 

    3.2 Representing K, I, and S

    Three simple combinators are derived completely to illustrate the
    methodology of combinator definition satisfaction.

    3.2.1 Representing K

    obap.E ≈ K

    For | K x y ≈ x, obap.ap(obap.ap(obap.E, a), b) = a.  
    Also,            obap.eval((obap.E :: ` a) :: ` b) = a
    for any obs a, b, including representations of combinators.
    In oFrugalese,   (.E x) y = x 

    This is very direct because 
    
         obap.ap(obap.E,x) = ob.e(x), 
         obap.ap(ob.e(x),y) = x, 
    and  obap.eval(obap.E) = obap.E,
    all by definition.

    Although it seems rather wasteful and difficult to interpret that y
    must be evaluated for no apparent purpose, it happens that there are 
    valuable idioms where y is fixed (e.g., `z) and is so encapsulated
    within a script as a payload for some idiomatic purpose.

    3.2.2 Representing | I x ≈ x

    ob.NIL ≈ I

    For | I x ≈ x,  obap.ap(ob.NIL, a) = a.
    Also,           obap.eval(ob.NIL :: ` a) = a
    In oFrugalese,  .NIL x = x

    This is also very direct because
         obap.ap(ob.NIL,x) = x, 
    and  obap.eval(ob.NIL) = ob.NIL,
    also all by definition.    
    
    3.2.3 Representing | S x y z ≈ x z | y z

    ^cS ≈ S

    where  ^cS = .C :: `.C
                    :: .C :: (.E :: .C :: (.E :: .ARG)
                                       :: `.ARG)
                          :: `(.C :: (.E :: .ARG)
                                  :: `ARG), 
           obap.ap(^cS, x) 
               = .C :: `( `x :: .ARG)
                    :: .C :: (.E :: .ARG) :: `.ARG),
           obap.ap(obap.ap(^cS, x), y) 
               = (`x :: .ARG) :: `y :: .ARG),
           obap.ap(obap.ap(obap.ap(^cS, x), y), z)
               = obap.ap( obap.ap(x, z), obap.ap(y, z) ),
    and in oFrugalese, ^cS(x, y) z = x(z) y z. 

    3.3 Derived Combinators

    For the additional useful combinators (1.2), we provide the chosen
    representation as operator script obs.  The derivations have been 
    obtained and confirmed using the SML/NJ mockup at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/mockups/SML/combdemo.sml>.
    These tend to be more compact than equivalent combinator representations 
    obtained by application of cS, cK, and other combinator representations.

    3.3.1 Representing | B f g x ≈ f | g x

    ^cB ≈ B

    where  ^cB = .C :: `.C 
                    :: .C ::  ( .E :: .E :: .ARG ) 
                          :: `( .C :: ( .E :: .ARG ) :: `.ARG ) 

    3.3.2 Representing | C f x y = f | y x

      Burge, William H.  Recursive Programming Techniques.  Addison-Wesley
      (Reading, MA: 1975).  ISBN 0-201-14450-6.  Although the approach starts
      with a functional-style, the interconnections and definability in terms
      of combinators and closed λ-expressions is worked up to in Chapter 1,
      with further refinement (and implementation matters) thereafter. 

   [Paulson1996]

      University Press (Cambridge: 1991, 1996).  ISBN 0-521-56543-X pbk. 
      Digging into the combinators, λ-calculus, and representation of other
      types as interpretations of λ-expressions occurs in Chapter 9, Writing
      Interpreters for the λ-Calculus, starting in section 9.5.

   [Révész1988]
      Révész, György E.  Lambda-Calculus, Combinators and Functional 
      Programming.  Cambridge University Press (Cambridge: 1988), ISBN
      0-521-345589-8.  The notational use of (f)(x)y for conventional f(x(y)),
      applicative f(x y), and combinatory | f | x y requires careful reading.  
      Chapter 3, Combinators and Constant Symbols, provides extensive examples
       also relevant to computational representations.  Section 2.4 provides
      a treatment of λ-expressions that can be adapted to the closed use
      in (1.2) here.

      Rosenbloom, Paul C.  The Elements of Mathematical Logic.  Dover (New
      York: 1950).  ISBN 0-486-60227-3 pbk.  The notation for expressing 
      combinators (1.1 here) and the expression of CA are derived from 
      section III.4, Combinatory Logics.

      Scott, Dana S.  Logic and Programming Languages. 1976 ACM Turing Award
      Lecture.  Comm. ACM 20, 9 (September 1977), 634-641.  PDF availabe at
      <http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1290000/1283932/a1976-scott.pdf>.  The
      discussion on semantic structures and function space is a valuable
      collateral on the use of monotonicity and continuity in [Scott1993],
      a paper originally circulated informally in 1969.

      The type-theoretic approach treats type as definite and distinguished
      even though the combinators are interpretable as polymorphic in the 
      manner proposed here for the combinators represented in oMiser.

 TODO:

  * Link to other materials of the Miser Project that explore some of these
    matters in greater detail.  Connect to combdemo.sml, and also work in
    Ycombinator (.txt or .sml?), and comblib.sml.

  * Salvage this statement somewhere here? "Combinator representations applied
    to representations of other types of functions will lead to some valuable 
    idioms in the composition of oMiser applicative scripts from other, 
    simpler ones."
