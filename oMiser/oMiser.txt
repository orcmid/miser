              OMISER CONCEPTION, DEFINITION, AND IMPLEMENTATION
              -------------------------------------------------

    oMiser is the foundation theory/software of The Miser Project.
    oMiser is the fundamental part of a software pair.

     - oMiser implements the representation and use of the
       abstract structure, ‹ob› as an encapsulated data-structure and
       universal machine implementation via reusable program library.

     - oFrugal is a front-end processor that offers an interface for
       external exercise of oMiser functions in a more-practical
       form for personal exploration and operation of oMiser programs.

    It is useful to view oMiser as a machine having obs as the form
    of its data and its programs.  The obs used as programs or
    scripts are akin to the machine-/assembly-language of conventional
    digital computers.

    oFrugal implementations provide input-output and other functions
    that oMiser necessarily lacks.  oFrugal is essentially a kind
    of assembler of oMiser obs and a means to exercise programs
    written as obs that compute other obs from given ones.  In particular,
    it presents the results of computations in the same notation(s) employed
    for the inputs.

    Development spirals, working through many iterations of implementation
    until stable operation, full functionality, and portability of
    oMiser and oFrugal are achieved.  Interoperation is via recording
    of oMiser dumps, oFrugal scripts, and distributed connections
    developed and extended over time.

    Stages beyond oMiser are envisioned.  In those cases, oMiser
    remains as a subordinate available for reliance when its simplicity
    is sufficient for fragments of larger, more-interactive arrangements
    of computational operations.

MANIFEST

    oMiser.txt
        this synopsis, manifest and TODOs for this portion of the
        working Miser-Project working folders preserved on GitHub

    ob.txt
        summary of how the ‹ob› structure and its computational
        manifestations are useful as flexible, general-purpose data
        structures given suitable encodings and decodings

    obtheory.txt
        specification of the ‹ob› abstract mathematical structure
        any computationally-implemented manifestation must satisfy.

    boole.txt
        Using abstract Boolean Algebra, demonstrating interpretations
        of additional abstractions in each other and in ‹ob›, arriving
        at idiomatic cases for computational-interpretation in oMiser

    obaptheory.txt
        specification of the ‹ob› universal function that every oMiser
        implementation manifests.

    conbinators.txt
        description of the nature of combinators and how they are represented
        in oMiser scripts for applicative interpretation.

    ob-exp.txt
        tombstone for specification of the grammar for oFrugal expressions
        that determine obs by computations using obs as procedure scripts and
        as data.  This material is now at
        <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oFrugal/ob-exp.txt>.

    CFob.txt
        description of the grammar for Canonical Obs and a procedure for
        expressiong them in strings that minimize use of "( ... )".

    mockups/
        subtree for experimental mock-ups that demonstrate oMiser
        features

TODO

  * Connect to internet-accessible resources and availability of stable
    materials when available.  TODOs and related work can be separated then.

  * Work up a COM-based interface protected implementation and see whether
    reference-counting is a workable avoidance of garbage collection by
    other means.

  * Check out Henry Baker's approach to using stack drag as a way to have
    rapid pair construction with only longer-lived material swept to the
    heap.

  * Deal with experimental speed-up devices, including tail recursion,
    to determine whether they are effective storage-reduction measures.

  * Consider a lab structure alongside the main dev and source-code
    structures.

  * Address platform variety (e.g., C/C++ versus .NET, Java, etc.) and
    also using oMiser at a binary level beneath systems such as Python.

  * Emphasize that this is a machine, machine data structure, and machine-
    language in the conventional sense.  And, at the oMiser/oFrugal level,
    we are basically seeing an assembler (reader) and a disassembler (printer)
    of the oMiser machine code.  Where oFrugal becomes more interesting may
    be with Proc and maybe something about data structures.

  * The Golden Geek treatment of the connection between these could perhaps
    be handled with an oMiser.md page here.  That could also address the
    programming notions.  It ties in the development of the "reference
    notation" for obs and the two sugared forms: lists, and expressions.
    See <https://www.facebook.com/MiserProject/> for now.

  * The grammar for reference notation is also needed, along with the
    oFrugal REPL additions (saving and substitution, etc.).

  * When representation, interpretation, manifestation, implementation,
    and simulation are worked out more clearly, review these materials
    for consistent usage and links to related resources of the project and
    and elsewhere, especially ones of reference/historical value.

  * There are a number engineering and programming matters in these TODOs
    that are best moved to an alternative place, such as engineering.txt
    for the overall project.

  * The fundamental reference that is a historical inspiration for obs and
    oMiser is [McCarthy1960] McCarthy, John.  Recursive functions of symbolic
    expressions and their computation by machine, Part 1.  Comm. ACM 3, 4
    (April 1960), 184-195, https://doi.org/10.1145/367177.367199

  * A related article of possible interest in accelerators or possibly other
    situations is [Perlis1960] Perlis, A.J., Thornton, Charles.  Symbol
    manipulation by threaded lists.  Comm. ACM 3, 4 (April 1960), 195-204,
    https://doi.org/10.1145/367177.367202

  * The Strachey General-Purpose Macro Processor (McG) is also inspirational,
    as is the Burge and Landin work on applicative systems and ISWIM.

  * How did the Mapping of ALGOL 60 to the lambda calculus deal with
    assignment operations and storage state?
