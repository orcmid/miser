              OMISER CONCEPTION, DEFINITION, AND IMPLEMENTATION
              -------------------------------------------------

    IMPORTANT NOTICE: The oMiser and oFrugal text-file materials are
        being refactored under docs/ where they are organized in
        conjunction with web materials.  This specific file will be
        whittled down until only a tombstone remains.  The omiser/
        folder will likely disappear.

        Meanwhile, this file is a zombie that is here only until the
        manifest files can be refactored to other locations, probably
        under docs/ as waypoints.

        Note that the TODOs are moved but the manifest and the
        summaries below are retained until additional refactoring
        is accomplished.

    oMiser is the foundation theory/software of The Miser Project.
    oMiser is the fundamental part of a software pair.

     - oMiser implements the representation and use of the
       abstract structure, ‹ob› as an encapsulated data-structure and
       universal machine implementation via reusable program library.

     - oFrugal is a front-end processor that offers an interface for
       external exercise of oMiser functions in a more-practical
       form for personal exploration and operation of oMiser programs.

    It is useful to view oMiser as a machine having obs as the form
    of its data and its programs.  The obs used as programs or
    scripts are akin to the machine-/assembly-language of conventional
    digital computers.

    oFrugal implementations provide input-output and other functions
    that oMiser necessarily lacks.  oFrugal is essentially a kind
    of assembler of oMiser obs and a means to exercise programs
    written as obs that compute other obs from given ones.  In particular,
    it presents the results of computations in the same notation(s) employed
    for the inputs.

    Development spirals, working through many iterations of implementation
    until stable operation, full functionality, and portability of
    oMiser and oFrugal are achieved.  Interoperation is via recording
    of oMiser dumps, oFrugal scripts, and distributed connections
    developed and extended over time.

    Stages beyond oMiser are envisioned.  In those cases, oMiser
    remains as a subordinate available for reliance when its simplicity
    is sufficient for fragments of larger, more-interactive arrangements
    of computational operations.

MANIFEST

    oMiser.txt
        this synopsis, manifest and TODOs for this portion of the
        working Miser-Project working folders preserved on GitHub

    ob.txt
        summary of how the ‹ob› structure and its computational
        manifestations are useful as flexible, general-purpose data
        structures given suitable encodings and decodings

    obtheory.txt
        specification of the ‹ob› abstract mathematical structure
        any computationally-implemented manifestation must satisfy.

    boole.txt
        Using abstract Boolean Algebra, demonstrating interpretations
        of additional abstractions in each other and in ‹ob›, arriving
        at idiomatic cases for computational-interpretation in oMiser

    mathZ.txt
        using the bvx Boolean Vector form, represent integer arithmetic

    obaptheory.txt
        specification of the ‹ob› universal function that every oMiser
        implementation manifests.

    conbinators.txt
        description of the nature of combinators and how they are represented
        in oMiser scripts for applicative interpretation.

    ob-exp.txt
        tombstone for specification of the grammar for oFrugal expressions
        that determine obs by computations using obs as procedure scripts and
        as data.  This material is now at
        <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oFrugal/ob-exp.txt>.

    CFob.txt
        description of the grammar for Canonical Obs and a procedure for
        expressing them in strings that minimize use of "( ... )".

    mockups/
        subtree for experimental mock-ups that demonstrate oMiser
        features

 0.0.17 2023-11-05T21:44Z Reduce to zombie state for this file.
 0.0.16 2023-11-01T18:22Z Introduce Refactoring of oMiser/ with docs, other
        folder structures.  Earlier history has moved to docs/oMiser.txt or
        whatever destination is used for preservation purposes.
