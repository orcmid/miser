                                 ZOMBIE FILE
                                 ===========

    IMPORTANT NOTICE: The oMiser and oFrugal text-file materials are
        being refactored under docs/ where they are organized in
        conjunction with web materials.  This specific file will be
        whittled down until only a tombstone remains.  The omiser/
        folder will likely disappear.

        Meanwhile, this file is a zombie that is here only until the
        manifest files can be refactored to other locations, probably
        under docs/ as waypoints.

        Note that the TODOs are no longer managed here.  The Manifest is
        retained until refactoring is completed.  This will become a
        crypt at that point.

MANIFEST

    oMiser.txt zombie refactoring at
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/oMiser.txt>)
        this synopsis, manifest and TODOs for this portion of the
        Miser-Project working folders preserved on GitHub

    ob.txt (tombstone)
        summary of the ‹ob› structure and its computational manifestations;
        migrated to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/ob.txt>

    obtheory.txt (tombstone)
        specification of the ‹ob› abstract mathematical structure
        any computationally-implemented manifestation must satisfy;
        migrated to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/obtheory.txt>

    boole.txt (tombstone)
        Using abstract Boolean Algebra, demonstrating interpretations
        of additional abstractions in each other and in ‹ob›, arriving
        at idiomatic cases for computational-interpretation in oMiser.
        Migrated to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obrep/boole.txt>.

    Z2adic.txt (tombstone)
        using the bvx Boolean Vector form, represent integer arithmetic
        with 2's complement binary numerals; migrated to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obrep/Z2adic.txt>

    obaptheory.txt (tombstone)
        specification of the ‹ob› universal function that every oMiser
        implementation manifests; migrated to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obap/obaptheory.txt>.

    conbinators.txt (tombstone)
        description of the nature of combinators and how they are represented
        in oMiser scripts for applicative interpretation; refactored to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obrep/combinators.txt>.

    ob-exp.txt
        tombstone for specification of the grammar for oFrugal expressions
        that determine obs by computations using obs as procedure scripts and
        as data.  This material is now at
        <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oFrugal/ob-exp.txt>.

    CFob.txt (tombstone)
        description of the grammar for Canonical Obs and a procedure for
        expressing them in strings, migrated to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/CFob.txt>.

    mockups/ (crypt)
        subtree for experimental mock-ups that demonstrate oMiser features now
        refactored to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/dev/mockups>.
