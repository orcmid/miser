                                  =========

    This material has been refactored to Orcmid Github miser/docs/, with
    distribution among ob/, obap/, and obrep/ as specified below.

    For the latest summary of The Miser Project on GitHub, go to
    <https://orcmid.github.io/miser> for that and further web pages
    on Miser.

MANIFEST

    oMiser.txt tombstone (this file)
       TODOs and other narrative are being repurposed as part of refactoring.
       There is no direct counterpart to this file.

    ob.txt (tombstone)
        summary of the ‹ob› structure and its computational manifestations;
        migrated to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/ob.txt>

    obtheory.txt (tombstone)
        specification of the ‹ob› abstract mathematical structure
        any computationally-implemented manifestation must satisfy;
        migrated to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/obtheory.txt>

    boole.txt (tombstone)
        Using abstract Boolean Algebra, demonstrating interpretations
        of additional abstractions in each other and in ‹ob›, arriving
        at idiomatic cases for computational-interpretation in oMiser.
        Migrated to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obrep/boole.txt>.

    Z2adic.txt (tombstone)
        using the bvx Boolean Vector form, represent integer arithmetic
        with 2's complement binary numerals; migrated to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obrep/Z2adic.txt>

    obaptheory.txt (tombstone)
        specification of the ‹ob› universal function that every oMiser
        implementation manifests; migrated to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obap/obaptheory.txt>.

    conbinators.txt (tombstone)
        description of the nature of combinators and how they are represented
        in oMiser scripts for applicative interpretation; refactored to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/obrep/combinators.txt>.

    ob-exp.txt (tombstone)
        tombstone for specification of the grammar for oFrugal expressions
        that determine obs by computations using obs as procedure scripts and
        as data.  This material is now at
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/oFrugal/ob-exp.txt>.

    CFob.txt (tombstone)
        description of the grammar for Canonical Obs and a procedure for
        expressing them in strings, migrated to
        <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/CFob.txt>.

    mockups/ (crypt)
        subtree for experimental mock-ups that demonstrate oMiser features now
        refactored to <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/dev/mockups>.

 0.0.21 2023-11-10T21:36Z Completion of refactoring away from oMiser folder.
 0.0.20 2023-11-10T20:46Z All refactored away except for ob-exp.txt
 0.0.19 2023-11-10T04:54Z Reflect refactoring of mockups/, leaving a crypt
 0.0.18 2023-11-09T23:14Z Reflect more refactoring from folder oMiser/
 0.0.17 2023-11-05T21:44Z Reduce to zombie state for this file.
 0.0.16 2023-11-01T18:22Z Introduce Refactoring of oMiser/ with docs, other
        folder structures.  Earlier history has moved to docs/oMiser.txt or
        whatever destination is used for preservation purposes.
