       FRUGALESE GRAMMAR FOR DISPLAYING CANONICAL OBS IN OB-EXP FORM
       -------------------------------------------------------------

    Show-ob is the grammar for Canonical Obs that exploits the right-
    associativity of "::" to eliminate unnecessary parentheses.  This
    is, apart from the presence of white space, a unique ob-exp for
    every Canonical Ob.
    
    The grammar is essentially ob-exp without anything that involves
    an application in its interpretation.

 1. SUMMARY GRAMMAR

    Here is the reduced summary grammar for the Canonical Obs.  Any
    of these forms are suitable.  Reducing the use of parentheses is
    handled in the procedure for expressing obs.

    〈term〉 ::= 〈lindy〉 | 〈primitive〉

    〈unary〉 ::= 〈term〉 | ( 〈canonical〉 ) | ‵ 〈unary〉 

    〈binary〉 ::= 〈unary〉 | 〈unary〉 :: 〈binary〉

    〈canonical〉 ::= 〈binary〉

 2. SIMPLE EXPRESSION

    Using SML/NJ, the expression of an ob, x, is as follows:

    def term(x: ob)
      = case x
          of obap.L(s) => s
           | ob.A => ".A"
           | ob.B => ".B"
           | ob.C => ".C"
           | ob.E => ".E"
           | obap.D => ".D"
           | obap.SELF => ".SELF"
           | obap.ARG => ".ARG"
           | obap.EV => ".EV"
           | _ => "?!"

    def canonical(x: ob)
      = let unary(x) 
            = if ob.is_individual(x)
              then term(x)
              else if ob.is_singleton(x)
                   then "`" ^ unary(ob.a x)
                   else "( " ^ canonical(x) ^ " )"
         in if ob.is_pair(x)
            then unary(ob.a x) " :: " canonical(ob.b x)
            else unary(x)
        end;
              
    To avoid Unicode console difficulties, the back-tick is used in
    this procedure.

TODO

  * In practice, we don't want to ever to insert more than one space at
    any point in the ob-exp.  The simple expression avoids that but it
    is more involved when there are more forms.

  * A pretty-print form that uses indentation is a bit trickier.  That
    needs to be done.  Line wraps should be used to honor margins.
