                          MISER THEORETICAL CONCEPTION
                          ============================

                   BASIS AS A THEORETICAL MODEL OF COMPUTATION

             If a result is important, you badly want to find different
             ways to see that fact; that's much safer.  If you have only
             one proof, and it contains an error, then you're left with
             nothing.  Having several proofs is not only safer, it gives
             you more insight, and it gives you more understanding.  After
             all, the real goal of mathematics is to obtain insight, not
             just proofs.

   ISBN 981-3083-59-X.  An objective in exploration of this material is using
   oMiser to demonstrate Algorithmic Information Theory, and its concrete
   cases, with sufficient translation of the version of LISP used by Chaitin.

   support including application to incompleteness and the Turing halting
   problem.  These should have aligned demonstrations in the oMiser computa-
   tional model interpretation of ‹ob› obap.ap.

   commitments in our application of Chaitin's ideas and algorithmic
   information theory.

TODO

 * Find other TODOs of this nature and transpose them to this file.

 * Reconcile the inclusion, by some, of partial functions under the
   effectively-computable ones.  This seems to collide with the halting
   problem.  Check the treatment of the Church-Turing Thesis in SEP and also,
   possibly in Davis and maybe Rogers.

 * Recover the article on the completeness of cons, car, and cdr for appeal
   with respect to ob.c, ob.a, ob.b, and ob.e.  Make the bridge to the
   completeness with respect to effectively computable obs.

 * Identify the stages for establishment of universality.

 * Identify the confirmations, including lambda-calculus, Turing Machine,
   and other simulations.

 * It might not be here, but the relationship to the Backus FP and FFP may
   require some explanation as well.

 * Address the apparent distinction around flavors of interpretation.

       element of what to explore via the Miser Project.
 0.0.0 2018-04-17-13:25 Create placeholder, with starter TODOs on the
       connection of oMiser to computation theory.
