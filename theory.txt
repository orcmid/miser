TODO

 * Find other TODOs of this nature and transpose them to this file.

 * Reconcile the inclusion, by some, of partial functions under the
   effectively-computable ones.  This seems to collide with the halting
   problem.  Check the treatment of the Church-Turing Thesis in SEP and also,
   possibly in Davis and maybe Rogers.

 * Recover the article on the completeness of cons, car, and cdr for appeal
   with respect to ob.c, ob.a, ob.b, and ob.e.  Make the bridge to the
   completeness with respect to effectively computable obs.

 * Identify the stages for establishment of universality.

 * Identify the confirmations, including lambda-calculus, Turing Machine,
   and other simulations.

 * It might not be here, but the relationship to the Backus FP and FFP may
   require some explanation as well.

 * Address the apparent distinction around flavors of interpretation.
