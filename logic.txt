                        LOGIC FOR MISER TO LOGIC IN MISER
                        ---------------------------------

             <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/logic.txt>

  There are two ways that logical deductions are employed in the Miser Project

    * Application of deductive logics in the formulation of Miser levels,
      starting with oMiser

    * As mechanized deductive arrangements in Miser itself that are applicable
      to Miser itself and potentially other systems, at least those having
      computational interpretations in Miser.

NOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY

 * David A. Wheeler recommended Metamath to my attention.  This might be
   helpful along with understanding of ACL2. <http://us.metamath.org/>.

 * There is cross-over between this treatment and confirming the ‹ob› model
   of computation and Church-Turing computability in theory.txt,
   <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/theory.txt>



[ACL2pedia]
   Wikipedia.  ACL2 article.  Current version available on the Internet at
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACL2>.  There is a natural affinity of
   Miser to the ACL[2] treatment of immutable functional computational
   interpretations and development of computational logic.  For oMiser, this
   level cannot be approached, although an underlying computational interpre-
   tation is achievable, short of an interface level appropriate to use in
   theorem proving about Miser programs and other cases of interest.

   Lemmon, E.J.  Beginning Logic.   Hacket (Indianapolis: 1978), ISBN
   0-915144-50-6 pbk. Version of the 1965 original modestly updated by George
   W. D. Berry. "[I]ntended primarily for students who have no previous
   knowledge of the subject, [forming] a working basis for more advanced
   reading and ... presented in such a way as to be intelligible to the
   layman.  The nature of logic is examined, with the gradual introduction of
   worked examples."  The notation employed differs from that used in The
   Miser Project, although it is not difficult to translate.  Although this
   book is not easy to find, there are affordable (under $10) used versions.
   The recommendation of this book, out of a large variety of alternatives,
   is for its development of logic as being about sound derivation of logical
   consequences. For the Miser Project we are content to go directly to
   "truth value" semantics for their direct applicability to considerations
   of computation.  Lemmon's more-leisurely development before introduction
   of truth-value semantics may be helpful in understanding formal logic's roots in natural language and rational conduct of human affairs.

TODO

 * Find a more-accessible modern treatment of logic for beginners.

 * Check for other sources that are closer to contemporary treatments and
   avoid the Principia Mathematica notation.

 * Dig deeper into Metamath once I have an oFrugal REPL and can see how to
   apply this, perhaps also in conjunction with Chaitin's AIS LISP codes.
