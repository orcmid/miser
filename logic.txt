                        LOGIC FOR MISER TO LOGIC IN MISER
                        ---------------------------------

             <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/logic.txt>

  There are two ways that logical deductions are employed in the Miser Project

    * Application of deductive logics in the formulation of Miser levels,
      starting with oMiser

    * As mechanized deductive arrangements in Miser itself that are applicable
      to Miser itself and potentially other systems, at least those having
      computational interpretations in Miser.

[SYNOPSIS: TBD]

[CONTENT: TBD]

NOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY

 * David A. Wheeler recommended Metamath to my attention.  This might be
   helpful along with understanding of ACL2. <http://us.metamath.org/>.

 * There is cross-over between this treatment and confirming the ‹ob› model
   of computation and Church-Turing computability in theory.txt,
   <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/theory.txt>

 * Treatment of logic here relies on the view that "Logic's
   main concern is with the soundness and unsndness of arguments, and it
   attempts to make as precise as possible the conditions under which an
   argument--from whatever field of study--is acceptable [Lemon1978:p.1]."
   In this respect, the dismissive "that's not logical" is often itself not
   logical.

 * We rely on denumerability of obs and applicability of structural induction
   in the fundamental logical structures considered in the Miser Project.  The
   definition of structures is contrived to allow the treatment and discussion
   of related but distinct mathematical structures and their formulations.
   This will continue into distinguishing computational interpretations used
   in representation of such structures, one in another.

[ACL2pedia]
   Wikipedia.  ACL2 article.  Current version available on the Internet at
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACL2>.  There is a natural affinity of
   Miser to the ACL[2] treatment of immutable functional computational
   interpretations and development of computational logic.  For oMiser, this
   level does not seem approachable, although an underlying computational
   interpretation is, short of an interface level appropriate to use in
   theorem proving about Miser programs and other cases of interest.  oFrugal
   might not be suitable to that task, although perhaps useful in a bootstrap
   of some procedural deduction.

   Elsevier (Amsterdam: 1977).  ISBN 0-444-86388-5 pbk.  An extensive work on
   which there is superficial reliance for the Miser Project.  The Guides are
   helpful in choosing where to look further in parts A (Model Theory),
   B (Set Theory), C (Recursion Theory), and D (Proof Theory and Constructive
   Mathematics).

   Barwise, John.  An Introduction to First-Order Logic.  Chapter A.1 in
   [Barwise 1977a], pp. 5-46.  In the use of formal logic here, a similar
   notation is employed for the logical connectives although most definitions
   and deductions do not make use of explicit quantifiers, being mainly
   equational.  With that said, "there are good reasons for considering
   first-order logic to be the basic language of mathematics (p.7)."

[Lemmon1978]
   Lemmon, E.J.  Beginning Logic.   Hacket (Indianapolis: 1978), ISBN
   0-915144-50-6 pbk. Version of the 1965 original modestly updated by George
   W. D. Berry. "[I]ntended primarily for students who have no previous
   knowledge of the subject, [forming] a working basis for more advanced
   reading and ... presented in such a way as to be intelligible to the
   layman.  The nature of logic is examined, with the gradual introduction of
   worked examples."  The notation employed differs from that used in The
   Miser Project, although it is not difficult to translate.  Although this
   book is not easy to find, there are affordable (under $10) used versions.
   The recommendation of this book, out of a large variety of alternatives,
   is for its development of logic as being about sound derivation of logical
   consequences.
      For the Miser Project we are content to go directly to "truth value"
   semantics for their direct applicability to considerations of computation.
   Lemmon's more-leisurely development before introduction of truth-value
   semantics may be helpful in understanding formal logic's roots in natural
   language and rational conduct of human affairs.

TODO

 * Find a more-accessible modern treatment of logic for beginners.

 * Check for other sources that are closer to contemporary treatments and
   avoid the Principia Mathematica notation.

 * Dig deeper into Metamath once I have an oFrugal REPL and can see how to
   apply this, perhaps also in conjunction with Chaitin's AIS LISP codes.

 * See if Eugenia Chang's "The Joy of Abstraction" is applicable to ways of
   viewing how computational as well as other interpretations are handled
   here.

 * Put my position paper and slides on Logic for CS Undergraduates somewhere
   that they can be linked from here.  This should be in a docs/ folio,
   but perhaps somewhere like nfoTools rather than only here.  Think it over.
