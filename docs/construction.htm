<p><i>The Miser Project site is the collection point for all current and 
historical materials on the project.</i></p>
<p><i>All project areas are weaved together by a consistent construction 
structure history.&nbsp; </i><i>The current construction-history technique is 
fashioned on that used for all sub-webs of </i><b><code>nfoCentrale.com</code></b><i>.</i></p>
<p><i>Construction Logs apply primarily to the physical construction and change 
of the web site and any mirror on which it resides, including on a file system 
or CD-ROM.&nbsp; The construction structure is undertaken in a self-conscious 
way and it is part of the accountability practiced everywhere on the site.</i></p>

<p><i>This Construction Zone provides change information for the Miser Project 
web root (Front Page) section:</i></p>

<ul>
  <li><i>There is a <a href="c000000.htm"><b>Diary &amp; Job Jar</b></a> kept just 
	for this particular Construction Zone</i></li>
  <li><i>There is an overall <a href="construction/"><b>Construction Materials</b></a>
    housing building plans and records for site-wide construction.</i></li>

  <dt><b>2002-07-11-14:05 We have a Logo (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I finally created a logo from an image just-added to the oMiser Sketch.&nbsp; 
	This logo will reflect the stage of Miser development.&nbsp; Some sections 
	will have this logo (semi-) permanently, and others will take on new flavors 
	of the Miser Theory logo as the work advances from one level to the next.</dd>

  <dt><b>2002-02-24-14:45 Organize as <code>miser-theory.info</code> under <code>

  <dd>The <b><i>Miser Project</i></b> subweb is adjusted for independent 
	mirroring under the nfoCentrale.net structure.<br>
    1. The subweb is given its own <b><code>/construction</code></b> section and 
	collateral sections.<br>
    2. The &quot;root&quot; on <b><code>InfoNuovo.com</code></b> is already the web 
	forwarding point for <b><code>miser-theory.info</code></b>.<br>
    3. Appropriate adjustments to previously-relative references external to the 
	Miser Project are begun, substituting absolute links to independent domains 
	(e.g., <b><code>orcmid.com</code></b>).<br>
    4. Construction history style is upgraded appropriately for a mirror under <b><code>
	nfoCentrale.net</code></b>.<br>

  <dt><b><a name="2000-09-02-15">2000-09-02-15</a>:24 Continue Site Expansion (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>Continuing the expansion, I make further additions to the site structure.<br>
    1. Reorganize the outline on the default page to reflect the kind of 
	organization we are producing and to provide linkage to the new sections.<br>
    2. Added a projects folder based on the existing 
	ODMA archetype.&nbsp; Cloned its construction set from the new notes 
	section, and primed a project summary with initial proposed projects.</dd>
  <dt><b><a name="2000-09-02-10">2000-09-02-10</a>:03 Expand Site Structure (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I have been heavily engaged in the support of 
	ODMA
    this summer, and the level of accountability and clarity introduced and 
	practiced there is beginning to pay off.&nbsp; I am basing my development of 
	other areas on the experience with ODMA.&nbsp; I&#39;ve also learned much about 
	how to organize the site so that people can use materials on-line and 
	off-line.&nbsp; Off-line usage is intended to encourage people who have such 
	material to always consult the on-line site for the latest material.&nbsp; I 
	am putting those practices in for the Miser site as well.&nbsp; I am not 
	dealing with collaboration support yet.&nbsp; The site is under a single 
	editorship/authorship for now.&nbsp; I will borrow collaborative support 
	from DMware as more 
	experience is gained there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I am raising the bar on organization of the Miser site.&nbsp; 
	While engaged with ODMA, I have been expanding my book collection and 
	searching out other materials related to the Miser Project.&nbsp; It is time 
	to begin organizing and consolidating what I have.&nbsp; Today&#39;s changes 
	provide the framework for that:<br>
    1. I spiffed up this construction page a little.&nbsp; This will be the last 
	place where so much &quot;diary&quot; occurs, because I am creating another place for 
	that.<br>
    2. I add the (technical) notes section.&nbsp; I ponder 
	whether to put a diary in here or not.&nbsp; I conclude that I don&#39;t need a 
	separate diary section, and that kind of note can go with the notes, with a 
	writings section when one is needed, or as part of a projects section, since 
	construction of the site is an internal Miser Project activity.<br>
    &nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b>2000-07-21-16:31 Update Notation Page (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>Replaced the code specimens by ones that work correctly, and include the 
	files for them too: [2023-08-22 That material is not being transposed to 
	here.]</dd>
  <dt><b>2000-07-19-00:21 Add Notation Page (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I added the notation page and primed it with the typography used for code 
	and data elements.</dd>
  <dt><b>2000-07-18-19:14 Stitch in the new Readings section (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>2002-02-24: I added a readings section similar to
    that for Orcmid&#39;s Lair<br>
    &nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b><a name="2000-06-13-16">2000-06-13-16</a>:55 Tweak the Synopsis some 
	more (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>1. As is my wont, I wordsmithed the synopsis a little more from the 
	changes made on 06-01.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    2. I added a link to Bob Bemer&#39;s latest web site.<br>
    3. I turned the background of the Miser Project home page to white to 
	reflect its moving from construction placeholder to content placeholder.<br>
    4. I linked the Miser Project home page to the miser/Obs subproject.<br>
    5. I did the same with the project synopsis.<br>
    6. I then tracked down Peter Landin and added a synopsis link for him also.<br>
    7. After checking over the initial Miser Obs material, I came back and gave 
	numbers and names to the seven themes.&nbsp; This is so I can 
	cross-reference and account for them in the contributions of other sections.<br>
    &nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b><a name="2000-06-01-09">2000-06-01-09</a>:22 Spin out separate Obs 
	sub-project (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>I created a separate Obs subproject and provided the 
	initial construction areas to use for further development.<br>
    &nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b><a name="2000-06-01">2000-06-01-08:23</a> Update Synopsis 
	Acknowledgments (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>Added influence of Bob Bemer in bringing together the group of people 
	whose ideas and discussions inspired my development of early ideas through 
	which I arrived at the Miser Project.</dd>
  <dt><b><a name="2000-05-29">2000-05-29</a>-17:29 Create Synopsis separate from 
	Project Home Page (orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>The initial project area is expanded to have the synopsis separate from 
	the home page, leaving room to reflect current and planned organizations of 
	the material.</dd>
  <dd>1. The original home page, containing the initial project synopsis, was 
	renamed to be the project synopsis, keeping it on 
	the side for consultation as details change and the project space is 
	populated by more working material.<br>
    2. The title of the synopsis page was corrected, eliminating one remaining 
    hangover from the ODMA page that was used to clone the synopsis.<br>
    3. The default page still on the VServers mirror was imported back as the 
	default and reduced to a simple default page that references the synopsis, 
	after a minimal summary.&nbsp; The Title of that page was also corrected.<br>
    4. An initial organization is introduced, but only the synopsis has any 
	content at this point.&nbsp; This organization will change as project 
	materials become available and as the project moves to new stages.<br>
    5. The index.htm page is given a last-update link and its title is also 
	corrected to reflect its location under the Miser Project.<br>
    &nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b><a name="2000-05-08-08">2000-05-08-08</a>:12 Cleanup initial materials 
	(orcmid)</b></dt>
  <dd>1. Adjust some of the wordings at the end of the project statement in 
	default.htm.<br>
    2. Repair two errors in this construction log that came from having copied 
	the same pages of the ODMA project as boilerplate.&nbsp; The date of 
	creation was shown as 1999 instead of 2000 and the project URL was still to <b><code>
	http://conclave/infonuovo/odma</code></b>.&nbsp;<br>
    3. Corrected spellings and updated the spelling dictionary for material of 
	this Change History.</dd>
  <dt><strong>2000-05-07-15:28 Create /miser project (orcmid)</strong></dt>
  <dd>1. The subdirectory was created for initiation of on-line materials for 
	the independent-scholarship Miser Project.&nbsp; It is being built with 
	FrontPage 2000 and managed as a typical project on the InfoNuovo site.&nbsp; 
	Materials are created and maintained on any Personal Web Server development 
	site running on one of the InfoNuovo Centrale computer systems.&nbsp; This 
	initial creation is on Compagno, the laptop I have with me during a six-week 
	visit to Italy.&nbsp; Publication of materials as a safeguard and also for 
	availability to others is accomplished by posting to the <b><code>
	www.infonuovo.com</code></b>
    web site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
  <dd>2. Default.htm, index.htm, and construction.htm pages are imported from 
	infonuovo.com/odma and customized as the basic construction pages for the 
	new infonuovo.com/miser project area.</dd>
  <dd>3. The default.htm page is expanded to provide a summary of the Miser 
	Project and its objectives, at a very high level.</dd>
  <dd>4. The index.htm page is set up to serve as the default entry page of the 
	construction structure, honoring the practice employed for all projects on 
	the site.</dd>
  <dd>5. This construction log, at construction.htm, is edited to carry the 
	information about the initial construction of the project area.<br>
    6. The pages are put under Visual Source Safe (via FrontPage 2000) and 
	shared with the VSS project for the VServers mirror area.&nbsp; The pages 
	will be available for public view the next time that updates to the VServers 
	site are uploaded.</dd>
