NOTES AND TODO

 * On 2008-04-23 (#60.124) I make mention of an LtU (?)article on Fetzer
   and the gap between logical theories, verification, and the contingent
   world in which software runs.  Practical/scientific/engineering success.
   Exploiting regularities in nature.  Having a circuit diagram, a blue
   print, a logical design, and a testable interpetation is a lot better
   than not having one.

 * On 2010-02-17 (#64.62) I rapsodize on Astrendo: Theory, Abstraction,
   Procedures. This will show up on the blog series about ‹ob› structure
   and in places where I discussed the manifestation of documents in computer
   systems.
    - Einstein on Theories versus Realities - I have a blog post about thta
      and I will reference it in a workshop contribution on Logic for Computer
      Science Undergraduates.  I must surface those materials and links.
    - Programming Concepts as Abstractions realized in Codes
       -- Modularity ideas
       -- The use of models as characterizations of informal theories
       -- Design reusability
       -- The conflict of programming model abstractions and the abstraction
          the software is used to manifest
       -- Structural abstractions in the representation vresus what is being
          represented
    - Matching abstraction of input-procedure-output in terms of domains and
      ranges
       -- but there can be structural abstractions on the procedure and its
          behavior that go to higher level
       -- these might or might *not* build to a higher level interpretation
          (theory) or they may be incidental to that
       -- TCP/IP and packet assembly, blocking in files, etc., versus putting
          the bits back together makes things a matter of indifference
           --- the invisible transport
           --- the structure one-level up
           --- sessions! connections - !
           [2025-11-15 observation: I have always been fascinated about this
            and I started musing on it when at Remington Rand Univac in the
            early 1960s.  The input-output models annoucned for IBM System/360
            had mee looking at this even more.]
    - A Turing Machine is a *structural abstraction*
    - The OSI 7-layer system versu the IETF one. (ALGOL versus other languages
      too.)

 * On 2010-02-20 (#64.66-67) I go off on Einstein on Theory+Reality.  There
   are citations and extracts on [Einstein1921].  This note is the basis for
   a blog post on this that is cross-posted to Numbering Peano.

 * On 2010-03-13 (#64.67) I come up with Bratman diagrams on how abstraction
   works above the T-diagram and its input and outputs.  I think this is on
   the blog series for computation interpretation and repreentation and need
   to recover it. As a time-check, I was immersed in ODF TC and also OOXML
   in this period.

 * In 2010-10-29 (#66.11) I make note "Astraendo: Computer Models" which seems
   to look at what Programmers Know, a follow-on to "What Computers Know."
   (look that up).  I saw programmers looking into computers as black boxes
   but where the model+rules are understood.  Outside looking in. Users know
   what is manifest at the surface and how it is seen as an instrument in
   their world of opportunity.  This applies to programmers too.

 * On 2010-12-02 (#66.11) On the same page I am doing a truth-value
   demonstration of a=b and b=c implies a=c.  I don't recall what my
   motivation was for this.

 * On 2010-12-03 (#66.29) I have a note on "Gödel's Formulation" but I don't
   see what of Gödel this is in reference to. It appears that "~" is "<=>"
   though.

 * On 2010-12-06 (#66.29) I see a note on "individuals" and reference
   Principia Mathematical *9.13 where it is said that x is an individual when
   it is neither a proposition nor a function.

 * On 2010-12-07 (#66.29) there is a quotation "in classical FOL an empty
   domain is prohibited."  It looks like Drake or Drahe and I have no idea
   who that is.

 * On 2011-02-08 (#66.70) I mention problems, opportunities, solutions, and
   concerns, breakdowns, barriers, obstacles, and instruments. [It seems as
   if I am looking at pattern languages.]
    - I pose "What is information science?  What is computer science?"
    - I observe "The conceptualization of reality is all our doing.  It is
      not arbitrary, being constrained by our experience and limitations
      thereof."
