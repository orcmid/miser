NOTES AND TODO

 * I am perusing old personal notebooks and identifying where various topics
   on the Miser Project arise.

 * The earliest materials are identified with respect to obtheory and are
   catalogued at <httsp://orcmid.github.io/miser/ob/ob.txt> for now.

 * On 2000-12-25 (#27.16) I start asking about truth values and is it
   necessary to have something like .YES and .NO? I also start pondering
   a predicate for is-determined, which would certainly be undecidable so
   I'm not certain where this musing is going.  These are pertinent for
   obaptheory though and I am continuing from here.

 * On 2001-01-01 (Notebook #27.25) I wonder off about is-determined-ob, but
   do get to the von Neuman stored-program property and how the essence of
   that applies. I identify some properties/factors that may be pertinent
   and that do not seem very clarifying on reflect now.
     - operating with Boolean values (true" and "false") and having
       recognizable propositional expression
     - trusting obs (?)
     - algorithms versus implementations
     - finiteness versus the countably infinite/unbounded but finite, etc.
     - identity and distribution of Obs (now considered under realism)
     - unstratified control and the eval/apply paradox (? really ?)
     - capacity for Obs. Dictionary/Concordance problem with Obs
       (and I don't think there is such a problem now)

 * On 2001-01-23 (#27.51-52) I worry myself about features but more famously
   that every individual of a class be typical of the class.  I will sort
   this out in the computational model.  I had imagined that COM interfaces
   help with demonstration of that. To make this more specific look at it
   this way. Numbers as we think of them do not have independent identity from
   number theory.  That is, a feature of the numerical interpretation of
   something like 3.14159 is more than just a sequence of seven glyphs.
   There's a context in which that is distinguished as signifying a member of
   some mathematical class and it is the whole of that (conceptually) that the
   individual connects into.  In some sense, each individual evokes the whole
   and in a computer representation I fancy that individuals should provide
   access to manifestation of any (though not literally the whole of course).
   I am cross-posting this with ob.txt.

 * There's more on the one page, including thinking about "Do Programs Teach
   Algorithms" at <https://orcmid.github.io/bib/2001/r010101.htm>.  That's
   about abstraction and arising-in-language but it's unclear what I'm raving
   about on #27.81.

 * On 2001-05-24 at #30.9, I recognize that when an ob-instance is a parameter
   of an ob function, assuming via COM interfaces, there is no way to be
   assured that the ob being delivered as a parameter to a function of another
   whether the parameter ob is for the same instance.  It could be remoted,
   it could be from a different one on the same computer, etc.  This is where
   I started to figure out how to have a way of knowing an ob-cell parameter
   is one of the same ‹ob› representation and one can work directly in that
   representation instead of over APIs that abstract above it. I think of this
   as a bit "aspect-oriented" ability to work at the implementation level
   than over the API that hides the underlying machinery and, in particular,
   organization of computer storage.

 * Continuing on 2000-05-20 (#20.82-86) I am looking at scripts and what
   are now .A, .B, .C, .E, .D (though .Q at first), .ARG, and .SELF.  Also
   a .NIL if needed.  I started figuring out scripts for combinators K and S.

 * On 2000-11-11 (#22.92) I have settled on .A, .B, .C, .D (not quite), and
   .E.  The Miser Project seems to be set aside for a time.

 * On 2000-12-25 (#27.16) I start asking about truth values and is it
   necessary to have something like .YES and .NO. I also start pondering
   a predicate for is-determined, which would certainly be undecidable so
   I'm not certain where this musing is going.  These are pertinent for
   obaptheory though.  (I will get around this by saying this is all
   determined by whatever the comparison operation returns, just like for
   LISP, C Language, and many others. The addition of Boolean types is fine,
   but the notion of true and false is actually to be discouraged.  It's
   really about what we mean by the question, even when we have some other
   two-valued distinction.)

 * On 2001-12-14 (#31.101) I am musing on Church's Thesis, not making much
   sense, but add a TODO to follow-up on what Church's Thesis *is*.  Instead
   of adding a FAQ on it, I now have a place to address it on
   <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/ct>.

  * On 2002-06-25 (#34.29) to 2002-07-02 (#34.34), I am working my way into
    the eval-apply business and some confusion that I seem to have had. I am
    also anticipating synthetic individuals. Too much metaphysics her though.

  * On 2002-07-04 (#34.37) I am working on a sketch for miser-theory.info. I
    come up with the diagram that will illustrate Ob everywhere (#34.39).

  * On 2002-07-06 (#34.40) I am getting Apply and almost ev(p, x, f).

  * On 2002-07-08 (#34.43) I have figured out the interpretation of the S
    combinator in ob with obap.
