                    HYBRID DOCUMENT-FORMATTING TEMPLATE
                    -----------------------------------

    This is a structure of nested web pages that provides boilerplate
    for topics under a particular project.  It is assumed that the
    construction material folder, construction/, and any over-all images
    folder, images/, are at the same level as the hybridForm/ folder.

    This is separated from construction/ templates in order for relative
    addressing into construction and elsewhere is already correct.

    Technically, it would be ideal to have this as a topic on docEng, with
    ability to populate other projects rather directly because of their
    compatible construction structures and Construction Material templaces.

    This is an "actual" topic that serves as its own boilerplate.  It is
    generally listed only in the construction structure.
