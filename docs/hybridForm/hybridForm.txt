                    HYBRID DOCUMENT-FORMATTING TEMPLATE
                    -----------------------------------

    This is a structure of nested web pages that provides boilerplate
    for topics under a particular project.  It is assumed that the
    construction material folder, construction/, and any over-all images
    folder, images/, are at the same level as the hybridForm/ folder.

    This is separated from construction/ templates so that relative
    addressing into construction and elsewhere is already correct.

    Technically, it would be ideal to have this as a topic on docEng, with
    ability to populate other projects rather directly because of their
    compatible construction structures and Construction Material templaces.

    This is an "actual" topic that serves as its own boilerplate.  It is
    generally listed only in the construction structure, not project-specific
    content topics.

    When this file is copied under the setup of a new topic, it is renamed
    to topic.txt, versioned for that, and with all of the text and Manifest
    updated accordingly, taking this only as boilerplate.
