## Hybrid Format

The hybridForm topic is designed as a topic-level template at the level of
GitHub Pages whether in a `project/docs`, the typical case, or in an overall
`project/` as the case for `orcmid.github.io/` authoring.  The key nature of
the hybrid format is that mixed HTML and Markdown are employed and the topic
level is at the same level as a `construction/` Construction Material folder.
`construction/` provides templates and some other features for use by
hybridForm pages.  The consistency of `construction/` content provides for
portable use of hybridForm.

In this arrangement, relative URLs from hybridForm topics into Construction
Material have no need for modification.  The modifications (such as logos)
that differ per project are provided in the Construction Material; those are
automatically propogated into HTML pages by Microsoft FrontPage design-time
features. Static web pages are the result.

Markdown pages in hybridForm (such as for authoring of this one), have
embedded HTML blocks that require some customization by means unknown
to FrontPage.  This is where "hybrid" comes in.  Embedded HTML blocks are
isolated at the beginnng and end of the Markdown.  The elements requiring
customization are identified by HTML comments directly in the HTML block.
Although that customization is usually manual, it also benefits from the
consistent availability of `images/` and `construction/`.

### Special Construction-Structure Topic

This page on the web is in the hybrid document format employed for content
topics of [Orcmid on GitHub](https://orcmid.github.io) projects.  It is an
annotated exemplar of the format it provides templating for.  It is viewed
as documentation [construction structure](index.htm).  As construction
material, it is not catalogued as a [technical content](../) topic (except in
[docEng](https://orcmid.github.io/docEng) where it is subject matter).

[hybridForm](./) has to be a peer of technical content topics in order to
have the required relative URL paths to materials over in
[construction/](../construction).  For this to work, templates and related
materials must be at the same locations in all
[construction/](../construction) Construction Material implementations. There
must be consistent availability of an [images/](../images/) folder as well.

### Deployment for Initiation of Topics

***TBD***

### Topic-Level Material

This page is produced from hybridForm file `index.md`.  It is meant to be
customized in any other topic where hybridForm is cloned as boilerplate.

There is HTML editing employed in the hybrid formatting, so it is generally
not possible to operate exclusively in Markdown format. For `*.md` pages, the
embedded HTML is easily customized when adhering to this Construction
Structure.

 There are also some `*.htm` completely-HTML portions in the hybrid format.
 These generally don't require editing by contributors to the technical
 content, including areas of the repository used for the creation of software.

There will be more information under the
[docEng](https://orcmid.github.io/docEng) project where this usage of
hybridFormat is as a model for use in other projects.

## Catalog (Specimen, hYYMMNN Content)

This placeholder links to raw materials and notes, including text files.
There will be organized folios of content as consolidation of documentation
on the web progresses.  The choice of accession number and prefix letter(s)
will be topic-specific and unambiguous within a project.

Note that whether there is a construction zone as part of the construction
structure depends on the situation.  The inclusion of text files is also
variable.

| **ID** | **Status** | **Started** | **Topic** |
|   :-:   |   :-:   |  :-:   |  ---  |
| [hyymmnn](yyyy/mm/hyymmnn.html) | placeholder | 2024-02-11 | Article placement |
|                         |          |            |                        |
| [h000001](h000001.htm)  | undated  | 2024-02-11 | Topic Articles Catalog |
| [h000000](h000000.htm)  | undated  | 2024-02-11 | Topic Diary & Job Jar  |

The construction structure and related text files are generally not
catalogued.  The curious can navigate the raw materials from the bottom-strip
hard-hat logo.
