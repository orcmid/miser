## Topic Synopsis or Overview <!-- CUSTOMIZE FOR THE INTENDED TOPIC -->

<!-- REPLACE THIS CONTENT WITH TOPIC-SPECIFIC STATEMENTS -->
> NOTICE: This is a work in progress.  The hybridForm technique is developed
*in situ* under the Miser Project on GitHub.  On completion for this initial
case, the material will be put in polished form under the
[docEng](../../docEng/) project.  There is some urgency to applying this
technique to the Miser Project first, so that continuing documentation and
development can proceed in this style of format.
> > dh:2024-03-02

This topic-level folder is an exemplar, a kind of self-describing template,
for topics and topical articles documenting the Miser Project on Github.  This
is Construction Material, but in the form of the exemplified topical content.

By topic-level is meant that this hybridForm folder is a direct sublevel of
a GitHub Pages source folder.  For the Miser Project, this is directly under
[miser/docs](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/tree/master/docs) and
published at
[orcmid.github.io/miser/hybridForm](https://orcmid.github.io/miser/hybridForm).

An entirely new Miser Project topic, or articles under existing topics, can be
initialized by selectively copying from this folder, renaming the copies, and
editing the copies to customize their content.  Each file of the `hybridForm/`
folder incorporates instructions and checklists for customization with
intended content.  For a new topic, the entire hybridForm folder can be
copied and renamed.  Alternatively, it can be done by pirating copies from
existing topics and portions of hybridForm/.

The Construction Structure and HTML-article pages depend on Microsoft Office
FrontPage 2003 features.  The hybridForm of Markdown pages does not. Take this
into consideration before employing hybridForm methodology in other projects.
Additional material and consideration of alternatives is found in the
[docEng](https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/) project.

> **IMPORTANT:** The customization instructions for this page are incorporated
  in the authored `index.md` form, not the published `index.html` form that
  is published via GitHub Pages.  The instructions are in HTML comments.

## Related Material

<!--
This placeholder links to raw materials and notes, including text files.
There will be organized folios of content as consolidation of documentation
on the web progresses.  The choice of accession number and prefix letter(s)
will be topic-specific and unambiguous within a project.

Note that whether there is a construction zone as part of the construction
structure depends on the situation.  The inclusion of text files is also
variable.
