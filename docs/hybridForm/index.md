## Hybrid Format

### Special Construction-Structure Topic

This material is in the hybrid document format employed for content topics of
[Orcmid on GitHub](https://orcmid.github.io) projects.  Although it is in the
format that it provides templating for, it is part of a projects documentation
[construction structure](../index.htm) and not catalogued as a
[technical content](../) topic.

### Topic-Level Material

This page is produced from hybridForm file `index.md`.  It is meant to be
customized in any other topic where hybridForm is cloned as boilerplate.

There is HTML editing employed in the hybrid formatting, so it is generally
not possible to operate exclusively in Markdown format. For `*.md` pages, the
embedded HTML is easily customized when adhering to this Construction
Structure.

 There are also some `*.htm` completely-HTML portions in the hybrid format.
 These generally don't require editing by contributors to the technical
 content, including areas of the repository used for the creation of software.

There will be more information under the
[docEng](https://orcmid.github.io/docEng) project where this usage of
hybridFormat is as a model for use in other projects.

## Catalog (Specimen, hYYMMNN Content)

This placeholder links to raw materials and notes, including text files.
There will be organized folios of content as consolidation of documentation
on the web progresses.  The choice of accession number and prefix letter(s)
will be topic-specific and unambiguous within a project.

Note that whether there is a construction zone as part of the construction
structure depends on the situation.  The inclusion of text files is also
variable.

The construction structure and related text files are generally not
catalogued.  The curious can navigate the raw materials from the bottom-strip
hard-hat logo.
