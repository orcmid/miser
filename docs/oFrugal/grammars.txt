              FORMAL GRAMMARS AND INTERPRETATIONS FOR oFRUGAL
              -----------------------------------------------

    Formalizations are employed to bridge from the structures of theoretical
    entities, particularly ‹ob›, to a corresponding formalization of the
    oFrugalese language to be processed and computationally-interpreted by
    oFrugal software.

 1. FORMAL APPROACH

    For Miser, formal structures are used to express and reason about
    theoretical entities of different types,

         ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉       at ..\oMiser\obtheory.txt and obaptheory.txt
         ‹ba› = 〈Ba,Baf,Bat〉     at ..\oMiser\boole.txt
         ‹bp› = 〈Bp,Bpf,Bpt〉        also
         ‹ca› = 〈CA,{apply},CAt〉 at ..\combinators.txt

    along with additional structures that serve mathematical purposes and
    have computational interpretations via representation in structure ‹ob›.

    oFrugal provides a computational mechanism by which computational
    interpretations of ‹ob› formulations can be carried out using textual
    inputs, producing textual expressions of derived Obs.

    oFrugal text forms, oFrugalese scripts, are defined with a formal grammar.
    Formal rules for interpretation of oFrugalese are given as companions to
    the grammar rules, establishing oFrugalese semantics.  The semantic are
    all in terms of ‹ob› constructions and application of the obaptheory.txt
    universal functions.

    Any canonical Ob determined in such interpretion is then presented as a
    textual result in CFob format, a subset of oFrugalese.
    (See ..\oMiser\CFob.txt)

    In effect, oFrugal is an Ob calculator that evaluates applicative
    expressions written in oFrugalese and delivers simple expressions for
    any Obs that are determined as results.

    The oFrugalese grammar and interpretation of single applicative
    expressions is provided in file ob-exp.txt.  The oFrugalese extensions
    for using the applicative expressions in computational scripts are
    defined in oFrugalese.txt.

    In this approach, the formal grammar and formal semantics (intepretation)
    do not specify any implementation in computer software.  That is achieved
    for oFrugal by employing the approach defined in mindelay.txt.

    Formal-grammar systems provide for precise specification of (usually-text)
    languages in terms of their syntactic structure.  These can be used along
    with a formal semantics for all grammatically-valid statements, providing
    precise and rigorous determination of the intended meaning.  This is part
    of nailing down computational models for precise realization in
    operational computer software.  The derivation of a processor is specified
    in the file mindelay.txt.

    This note provides background and definitions that are exploited in
    establishing the formal grammar and interpretation of oFrugal texts.
    The specific grammar and interpretations are found in files ob-exp.txt and
    oFrugalese.txt in this folder.  The scheme used by the parser is specifed
    in the file mindelay.txt.  Together, taken along with the structure
    ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉and the universal applicative functions, they provide a
    precise specification for an oFrugal reference implementation.

 1. GRAMMARS AND PARSERS

    Here, grammars are taken as descriptions of the structure of texts in a
    language, and how those structures are interpreted -- the semantics of
    the texts.  The grammar establishes the acceptable syntax of texts and
    their interpretation.

    A parser and a parsing system are related to grammars and their semantics,
    but grammars do not directly specify parsers.  Grammars do constrain what
    any parser shall accept and how it conforms to an intended semantics.

    Although it is commonplace in computer science to blur grammars and
    parsers together, for oFrugal parsing will be distinct, though aligned
    with the grammar and specified semantics.

 2. PHRASE-STRUCTURE GRAMMARS IN BACKUS-NAUR FORM (BNF)

    Phrase-structure grammars were introduced by Nohm Chomsky as part of
    a hiearchy of grammar formalizations below what one might require in
    formalizing the grammar of a natural language [Chomsky1956].  In later
    treatment[Chomsky1959], phrase-structure grammars are identified as
    type 2, context-free, grammars; the terms are interchangeable.  The term
    "context-free" has a precise and very narrow meaning.  To avoid confusion
    with any informal idea of context, "phrase-structure" is preferred.

    Use of BNF notation for expressing phrase-structure grammars exploded in
    the 1960s after inspiration by [Backus1958] and adaptation for ALGOL 60
    [Naur1963].  The idea that one could specify a programming language in a
    formal manner and derive a parser in a mechanical way was compelling.

    Phrase-structure grammars are commonly used in the specification of
    programming languages, with any additional grammatical constraints usually
    given as side-conditions and constraints.

    oFrugalese, the language accepted by the oFrugal REPL, is precisely
    and completely specified in BNF.  There are no side conditions.  Every
    grammatical text is completely valid: every grammatical text has definite
    semantic interpretation, without exception.  This is a counterpart of the
    definition of the oMiser universal function in which every ob has an
    applicative interpretation.

 3. BNF NOTATION FOR THE MISER PROJECT


    *** We will use phrase categories instead of non-terminals, but the
    idea is the same.  In particular, when there are no non-terminals in
    a sequence (i.e., only terminals), that is a terminal phrase.  There is
    no further expansion available.
    ***

        The concrete reference syntax consists of Unicode, usually in UTF8
    encoding, and a %-escape mechanism is used when a character is not
    printable.  It is recommended that characters that are not easily typed
    be avoided by authors of ob expressions, recognizing that a recipient
    may encounter %-encoding instead.  If you don't know what this is about,
    you are probably on safe ground. [SEE HOW INTERNATIONALIZATION OF C
    LANGUAGE IDENTIFIERS IS HANDLED]

    Basically, white-space is allowed wherever it does not change the
    grammar of a 〈term〉 and required where consecutive 〈term〉 occurrences
    would not be disambiguated.


 4. EXPRESSION INTERPRETATION

   ** Two things about choice of grammar.  First, the desire to have a
   particular form that does not change the set of valid sentences but is
   more amenable to derivation of a syntax-oriented parser.  The second is
   related to expedite the correspondence of phrase structures with the
   intended interpretations.  These pragmatic and highly-practical maneuvers
   are unnecessary, in principle, but extremely valuable in practice.

    Interpretation of expressions as obs is accomplished using a special
    schema notation that specifies the Ot (‹ob› theory-language) expression
    interpretation of a given ob-exp text.  The interpretation schemas have
    distinct form.

       ‼ category ⎾pattern⏋{parameter-list} =: interpretation

    where      category is one of the syntactic categories, such as
                        〈ob-exp〉, 〈ae〉, and 〈term〉

                pattern is one of the patterns for the particular category,
                        such as 〈binary〉, 〈obap-form〉 〈ae-form〉, and 〈lindy〉

       {parameter-list} is an optional form consisting of a list of
                        one-or-more parameters

         interpretation is an obaptheory expression schema in which any
                        parameter and "‼ category {parameter-list}" forms are
                        in reference to category appearances in the pattern;
                        parameters of the pattern {parameter-list} may
                        occur as variables in the interpretation, including
                        in further {parameter-list} forms.

    The obaptheory formulation in Ot, the theory language of structure
    ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉, is available at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obaptheory.txt>.

    For example,

        ‼〈ae〉⎾〈obap-form〉 〈ae-form〉⏋{ℰ} =: obap.ap(‼〈obap-form〉{ℰ},‼〈ae-form〉{ℰ})

    On the right-hand side of the "=:" the category names refer to those
    in the pattern on the left-hand side, and the interpretations of those
    occurrences is called for to determine the individual ob that is their
    evaluation.

    The parameter ℰ employed in many interpretations signifies the ob-exp
    environment, the means by which the current oFrugal set of bindings
    is used to resolve binding names and provide unknown-name forms otherwise.
    This is tied to interpretation of oFrugal statement-level syntax.

    Although the rules are tied directly to the forms of the grammar, the
    notation is relaxed to also describe interpretation of parsing stages.
    For example (cf. section 9),

      ‼〈ob-exp〉⎾ f g x ⏋{ℰ}
          =: ‼〈binary〉⎾ f g x ⏋{ℰ}
          =: ‼〈ae-form〉⎾ f g x ⏋{ℰ}
          =: obap.ap( ‼〈unary〉⎾ f ⏋{ℰ}, ‼〈ae-form〉⎾ g x ⏋{ℰ} )
          =: obap.ap( ‼〈function-form〉⎾ f ⏋{ℰ}, ‼〈ae-form〉⎾ g x ⏋{ℰ} )
          =: obap.ap( ‼〈term〉⎾ f ⏋{ℰ}, ‼〈ae-form〉⎾ g x ⏋{ℰ} )
          =: obap.ap( f, ‼〈ae-form〉⎾ g x ⏋{ℰ} )
          =: obap.ap( f, obap.ap(‼〈unary〉⎾ g ⏋{ℰ}, ‼〈ae-form〉⎾ x ⏋{ℰ} ) )
          =: obap.ap( f, obap.ap( g, x) )

    where lindies such as Ʃ'f', Ʃ'g', and Ʃ'x' are written as f, g, and x
          without ambiguity in these cases.

    We can also work out that

      ‼〈ob-exp〉⎾ f g x ⏋{ℰ} :=: ‼〈ob-exp〉⎾ f (g x) ⏋{ℰ}

    signifying that the interpretations are the same (i.e., equivalent),
    keeping in mind that the f, g, and x here are literals and not variables.
    While the equivalence doesn't hold under arbitrary substitutions for f,
    g, and x, the following can be established.

      ‼〈ob-exp〉⎾ 〈unary〉₁ 〈unary〉₂ 〈unary〉₃ ⏋{ℰ}
          :=: ‼〈ob-exp〉⎾ 〈unary〉₁ ( 〈unary〉₂ 〈unary〉₃ ) ⏋{ℰ}

    with the subscripts used to distinguish among 〈unary〉 occurrences,
    following [Knuth1968].

       A general parser (syntax analyzer) for context-free languages is
    described.  What we now refer to as a lexical analyser is identified as a
    recognizer layer.  The analyzer method is most easily recognized as a
    top-down parser with back-tracking.  It could even be used to produce all
    analyses available for an ambiguous input.  Refinements of this method
    that I have explored include pruning alternatives when they cannot be
    possible if the input will be valid.  This allows early analysis to be
    forwarded to a generation layer.  There also needs to be some assistance
    in the case of left-recursive generations, usually expedited by
    transformation into tail-iterative forms.

       Seeking a model applicable to natural languages, Chomsky identifies
    finite-state languages (now type 3: regular expressions), phrase-
    structure languages (now type 2: context free), and transformational
    languages, the last having his focus.

       Here Chomsky's models are formalized more fully, establishing a
    hierarchy from recursively-enumerable (type 0, uninteresting for
    linguistics) and descending into strictly-tighter subsets with
    context-sensitive (type 1), context-free type 2), and finite state
    (type 3).  There is a layer (recursive languages) within type 0 and
    containing type 1, so all of types 1-3 are recursive and hence
    decidable.  These are generative grammars: production of grammatical
    strings is described, not to be confused with notation-borrowing
    schemes for the parsing of such text strings.

       This paper made use of nested 〈 ... 〉 in a peculiar way, but it inspired
    me to use it to use productions to generate naming of phrase categories,
    providing a vocabulary grammar and generic arrangements, including moving
    between concrete cases such as 〈integer〉 and 〈〈integer〉-length-string〉.
    This is not needed here.  I just want this reference set to be complete
    wherever I use it.

       This provided a type of generic context-free production that inspired
    some of this work, although not relied upon in the ob-exp grammar.

       Section 1, Introduction, offers a precise definition of context-
    free (mechanical) languages along with important considerations such
    as their decidability.  Although it is undecidable, in general,
    whether a given context-free grammar is ambiguous, it is possible to
    determine when a particular statement is by relying on a parser such
    as that of [Cheatham1964].

       The semantic interpretations for oFrugalese are similar to those of
    Knuth's attribute grammars except that the arrangement remains context-
    free and cycles are generally not possible.  In the oFrugal application,
    all well-formed inputs have semantics and there are no forward references,
    although there can be semantical context.  In particular, binding names
    are always references to the nearest preceding bindings, if any, and the
    absence of a preceding binding is semantically acceptable.  Pragmatically,
    there may be warning messages or even aborts of processing as an option.

       Quasi-quotation is introduced in Section 6. Quine's devotion to the
    inspiration of [Whitehead1997], itself an outgrowth of Russell's
    inspiration in Euclid, foretells the further simplification of formal
    mathematical logic that has left behind the original notations and the
    hierarchies of types.  In Chapter 7 on Syntax, the formal development of
    logic itself is undertaken.

       The full three volumes, first published in 1910, was an epochal event.
    It provided a platform on which questions of decidability and the work
    of Gödel, Church, Turing, and others would be erected.  The appeal to
    Newton's 1687 work of similar title reflects the aspiration of the authors
    to grasp the foundation of mathematics as derivable from logic.

TODO

 * Consider moving this to docs/cs/ where the general idea about phrase-
   structure grammars and the background can be addressed.  Here, for oFrugal,
   we only need to deal with what is needed for oFrugal and the technique can
   be addressed more broadly from docs/cs/.

 * Prune these TODOs to remove those that apply to oFrugalese, ob-exp, or
   other topics.

 * Revealing examples are needed here.  Grace Hopper favored that and I
   should heed it for that reason alone.  [This applies more to ob-exp.txt and
   oFrugalese.txt though.]

 * Cite other forms of BNF, such as the EBNF used at IETF, others.

 * Cite the Ned Irons paper on syntax-directed compiling for its historical
   importance.

 * Cite Quine for the quasi-quotation marks and also refer to the Wikipedia
   article, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-quotation>.

 * Add the handling of concrete cases and the tie-in to a reference
   character code, akin to the counterpart in the XML specification.

 * Use the XML 1.0 (Namespaces) characterization of white space, letters,
   digits, and the restricted allowance of other characters in ob-exp terms.
   Provide a reference.

 * It is necessary to make clear that these are generative grammars and there
   should be some links about those.  The Saul Gorn clarity would be useful.

 * Organize the historical discussion to follow the specifics for oFrugal.

 * Identify Pattern Languages, in Alexander's formulation, as similarly
   linguistical, though conceptually different (i.e., not about texts)

 * Find the material on Post's production system and also its use in the
   the material referenced by John W. Carr, III.

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form may be useful.  I
   notice I am skimping and not dealing with white space and optional white
   space.  I can't ignore that in the lexical rules.

 * There can be pragmatics about some things.  I just had a thought about that
   and now I have lost the case that inspired this remark.
