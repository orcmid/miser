                     OFRUGALESE LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION
                     ---------------------------------

    The oFrugal REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) console application
    processes lines of input as a continuous stream of material.  That
    stream is required to conform to the oFrugalese language specification.

CLIPPINGS

[These materials are extracted from a draft version of grammars.txt where
 they are not used.  Whether adapted for use here is to be determined later.]

    Ob-exp texts are used as a means of specifying obs and computations
    with them to derive an ob result.  Ob-exp is an expression language
    that is used in digital communication of computations with obs and
    also used to submit expressions for oMiser computation via oFrugal.

    ob-exp has a context-free grammar, here specified using the original
    Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as employed in the Revised Report on
    the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60.  The grammar specifies exactly those
    expressions that can be evaluated to (at most) a single ob when submitted
    to a processor such as an oFrugal implememtation.

    In addition to the grammatical structure for composing ob-exp
    expressions, there is also a formal definition of the computation by
    which an ob-exp is evaluated as computation of a canonical ob, the
    formal semantics of ob-exps.  It is this fact that has ob-exp be defined
    under oMiser, even though it is oFrugal that will enact that semantics.

    For an informal introduction to the use of Frugalese in the computational
    model defined on the mathematical structure ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉, see
    <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/ob.txt> and other
    material cited there.

    The following summary form of the grammar is useful for reference.
    It does not address the grammatical differences that are called for
    to align with the interpretation rules by which an ob-exp is evaluated.
    The notation is the same used for the ALGOL 60 Report [Naur1963], as
    adapted from a John Backus demonstration for ALGOL 58 [Backus1958].

            The concrete reference syntax consists of Unicode, usually in UTF8
    encoding, and a %-escape mechanism is used when a character is not
    printable.  It is recommended that characters that are not easily typed
    be avoided by authors of ob expressions, recognizing that a recipient
    may encounter %-encoding instead.  If you don't know what this is about,
    you are probably on safe ground. [SEE HOW INTERNATIONALIZATION OF C
    LANGUAGE IDENTIFIERS IS HANDLED]

    Basically, white-space is allowed wherever it does not change the
    grammar of a 〈term〉 and required where consecutive 〈term〉 occurrences
    would not be disambiguated.

TODO

 * Incorporate shared references from ob-exp.txt with regard to the grammar
   and the use of 〈ob-exp〉.

 * Provide the interpretation of ‼〈binding-name〉{ℰ} where
   〈binding-name〉 ::= ^〈plane-lindy〉 | ?〈plane-lindy〉 | ?.〈plane-lindy〉

 * Provide a look-up function that works on that returns matches for
   certain lookups and returns the ? form when it is not there is no
   established binding.

 * Establish that all grammatically-correct streams have interpretations,
   though an attempted computation may fail by resource exhaustion.

 * Produce the input-statements grammar to first just have binding commands
   and expressions.

 * Add #include and see how that works.

 * Start a table of contents

 * Address the overall structure

 * Address error-reporting/-handling.

 * Provide the environment that is used to add accumulate binding and supply
   them to ob-exp interpretations.

 * Include file and line identification in the handling of REPL sessions and
   provide for error identification/location messages that are useful in
   locating problem points in the input source.

 * Consider line-numbering in the entry of input or maybe only in a CUA editor
   or maybe even in Visual Studio Code.
