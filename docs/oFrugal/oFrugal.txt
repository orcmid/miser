                   OFRUGAL REPL DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION
                   --------------------------------------

    oFrugal REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) is the oFrugalese component of the
    pair

     - oMiser representation and use of the abstract structure, ‹ob› as an
       encapsulated data-structure and universal machine implementation via
       reusable program library.

     - oFrugal front-end processor offering an interface for external
       exercise of oMiser functions in a more-practical form for personal
       exploration and operation of oMiser programs.

    oFrugal implementations provide input-output and other functions that
    oMiser necessarily lacks.  oFrugal is essentially an assembler/calculator
    of oMiser obs, a means to exercise scripts written as obs that compute
    other obs by applicative operation.  In particular, oFrugal presents
    the results of computations in the same notation(s) employed for inputs.

    It is characteristics of the ob-calculator approach that if an output is
    presented as an input, the result for that input will be equivalent to
    the original output, rather than some further calculation.

    For the oFrugal calculator as a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop),
    the file oFrugalese.txt specifies the grammar and its interpretation for
    the input as a continuous stream.  Other files are for aspects of the
    concrete implementation and the interchange of files among them.

NOTES AND TODO

  * [2026-01-08] To break my perfectionalism obsession, start a development
    spiral that works not unlike the VCrayApp setup except we'd doing the
    library (essentially oMiser) and the application.  So I can use that
    structure.  Because it is test-first, I need to start with oFrugal first,
    although that doesn't have to be strictly true.

  * [2016-01-08] The oFrugal parser is basically a fairly straightforward
    precedence parser.  The depiction and development for that part will be
    using the notation introduced by Bob Floyd for this purpose.  I just have
    to find it.

  * Create these, with attention to the division of labor and the reliance
    on the common ob-exp txt.

  * Explain the oMiser mockup case because of file-system location of
    SML scripts.  There needs to be some principle applied on this.

  * Maybe need notes and references?

  * In processing and handling of Unicode, bidirectionality has to be
    constrained in a manner where the key lexical structure is not disturbed
    and there is no ambiguity with regard to parsing.

  * Create reference specifications for lexical structure of input texts from
    keyboards, streams, and persistent data.  The reference character set is
    Unicode and the reference encoding is UTF-8.  We also need to cope with
    rulers (or not) and line numbering in a way that is useful.  This could
    be part of the AI.

  * lexical.txt will provide the lexical-level of processing.  There will be
    a basic character-stream case and that will be supplemented by two levels:
    recognition of specific tokens and then the regular elements.

  * mindelay.txt is the REPL parser structure.  It is related to the Alan
    Perlis "mindelay-scan-doer" scheme for a mostly one-pass process where
    an operation can be carried out as soon as its operands are determined.
    For oFrugal that one-pass process calculates obs and provides for the
    binding of obs and the access to those bound obs in subsequent
    expressions.  This is a moderately-extended precedence parser.  Behavior
    of this parser procedure can be verified against the context-free grammar
    for the same oFrugal texts.  The handling of error cases is beyond what
    the grammar determines.

  * The encounter of an invalid binding could well allow editing and restart.
    This might also work for insertion of a !def that copes with a wrong
    binding.  Or maybe just fix the offending file and resume.  But there does
    need to be an editor that provides line numbers and movement by them.  So,
    maybe not such a bright idea after-all.  There is something to this, I
    just don't have my head around it.  Maybe we put the processed text into
    a log, if it is not being brought in from a file in the first place?

  * Digging into my file cabinet, under F80.11 Combinatory Systems, I find
    that I was fussing with Frugal in 1979-1980, although I don't think I
    had the clarity on ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉at that point.  The choice of LISP-
    like structures did not strike me until I saw an article on XLISP in
    Dr. Dobb's Journal.  Until that point I had been thinking of string
    manipulation (inspired by Strachey) and not list structures.

  * In casep.txt, .F should be used where ` v was used, since no need to
    enclose a symbolic form and everything works out anyhow.  I am here
    anticipating that symbolic forms will be flagged in ob-cells and there
    is never any need to look down a list to satisfy is-symbolic-form(x).

  * On 2006-09-05 (#54.72) I muse on [a,b] just be a pairing (as opposed to
    [a,b:] which is later adopted).  I don't have "::" for right-associative
    pairing yet.  (I didn't express CFob until 2018.)  I have unchecked notes
    to consult Burge and also Backus (FP) on the matter.

  * On 2007-09-25 (#59.34) I muse on IDEs, being able to fix things from the
    command line, and conclude that let's just stick to the source-code file
    and editing it, not unlike working with SML.  There are thoughts about
    dump formats which could be interchanged/reloaded, but that's another
    matter.

  * On 2007-10-25 (#59.72) I contend with there not being "free" occurences
    of variables in Miser and oFrugal in the sense that is meant in the
    mathematical formulation of λ-expressions.  There are no variables, to
    start with.  I am still formulating, and the comment is generally off-base
    compared to where this all ended up.

  * On 2007-10-27 (#59.74) I am still muddling with this.  I also had the odd
    idea that `f.x` be equivalent to `(f 'x)` and that's not it at all.  Some
    of this pondering is that oFrugal λ-abstraction is a rewriting action and
    there are no variables whatsoever at the expression level.

  * On 2007-10-27 (#59.75) I am still a bit stuck, but the remarks about
    caching *proc* synthetics now makes sense.  It is about making them
    individuals and hence they need to be somewhere that occurences of the
    same *proc* definition end up having the same individual.  I'm still
    stuck about free variables though.

  * On 2008-02-11 (#60.66) I start putting together the Frugalese applicative
    notation.  The notation is being imagined as it is today, with application
    being right associative.  a b c d is the same as a(b(c(d))).  I am pretty
    clear about it.

  * On 2008-02-12 (#60.72-73) I am more clear about the applicative structure
    and it is exactly in this form to this day (2025-11-12).

  * On 2008-02-20 (#60.88) I am still rationalizing the notation I have zeroed
    in on.  I still haven't gotten to "::" yet.  I'm also referring to a
    (blog?) post and I need to go back and look at the Numbering Peano blog.
