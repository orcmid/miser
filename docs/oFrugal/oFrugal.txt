                   OFRUGAL REPL DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION
                   --------------------------------------

    oFrugal REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) is the oFrugalese component of the
    pair

     - oMiser representation and use of the abstract structure, ‹ob› as an
       encapsulated data-structure and universal machine implementation via
       reusable program library.

     - oFrugal front-end processor offering an interface for external
       exercise of oMiser functions in a more-practical form for personal
       exploration and operation of oMiser programs.

    oFrugal implementations provide input-output and other functions that
    oMiser necessarily lacks.  oFrugal is essentially an assembler/calculator
    of oMiser obs, a means to exercise scripts written as obs that compute
    other obs by applicative operation.  In particular, oFrugal presents
    the results of computations in the same notation(s) employed for inputs.

    It is characteristics of the ob-calculator approach that if an output is
    presented as an input, the result for that input will be equivalent to
    the original output, rather than some further calculation.

    For the oFrugal calculator as a REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop),
    the file oFrugalese.txt specifies the grammar and its interpretation for
    the input as a continuous stream.  Other files are for aspects of the
    concrete implementation and the interchange of files among them.

TODO

  * Create these, with attention to the division of labor and the reliance
    on the common ob-exp txt.

  * Explain the oMiser mockup case because of file-system location of
    SML scripts.  There needs to be some principle applied on this.

  * Maybe need notes and references?

  * In processing and handling of Unicode, bidirectionality has to be
    constrained in a manner where the key lexical structure is not disturbed
    and there is no ambiguity with regard to parsing.

  * Create reference specifications for lexical structure of input texts from
    keyboards, streams, and persistent data.  The reference character set is
    Unicode and the reference encoding is UTF-8.  We also need to cope with
    rulers (or not) and line numbering in a way that is useful.  This could
    be part of the AI.

  * lexical.txt will provide the lexical-level of processing.  There will be
    a basic character-stream case and that will be supplemented by two levels:
    recognition of specific tokens and then the regular elements.

  * mindelay.txt is the REPL parser structure.  It is related to the Alan
    Perlis "mindelay-scan-doer" scheme for a mostly one-pass process where
    an operation can be carried out as soon as its operands are determined.
    For oFrugal that one-pass process calculates obs and provides for the
    binding of obs and the access to those bound obs in subsequent
    expressions.  This is a moderately-extended precedence parser.  Behavior
    of this parser procedure can be verified against the context-free grammar
    for the same oFrugal texts.  The handling of error cases is beyond what
    the grammar determines.

  * The encounter of an invalid binding could well allow editing and restart.
    This might also work for insertion of a !def that copes with a wrong
    binding.  Or maybe just fix the offending file and resume.  But there does
    need to be an editor that provides line numbers and movement by them.  So,
    maybe not such a bright idea after-all.  There is something to this, I
    just don't have my head around it.  Maybe we put the processed text into
    a log, if it is not being brought in from a file in the first place?
