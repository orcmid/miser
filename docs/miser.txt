                               The Miser Project
                               =================

                        <https://github/orcmid/miser>

                     TRACKING THE MISER PROJECT ON GITHUB
                     ------------------------------------

           TRACKER: <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/miser.txt>

               THIS FILE REPLACES THE NOW TOMB-STONED FILE AT
          <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/miser.txt>

    NOTE: Generally, folders of the Miser Project on GitHub repository
          have folder.txt text files where the folder name is used.
          This "Tracker" file serves that purpose, although it is
          under folder miser/docs for accessibility on the web while
          having maintenance be in exactly one place.

    The Miser Project is being moved to GitHub in its entirety.  It is also
    being made web-centric, so that the authoritative text files of the
    project are housed in web folders from which orcmid.github.io/miser is
    published.  This proximity improves the likelihood that there is no
    maintenance drift between web presentations and authoritative text files.

    The main introduction and sketch is the page now  presented at the link
    <https://orcmid.github.io/miser>.  Technical details of the web presence
    construction are all connected via a scaffolding underpinning that
    commences at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/index.htm>.

TODO

  * I have no idea why I called this a "shadow" file. I need to look at the
    "original" in the full GitHub repository and figure out what I mean and
    where maintenance is intended to continue.  I am renaming it to be a
    "tracker" since it is under docs/ but about the overall GitHub repository
    organization.  2025-11-11: Then I forgot about this and was confused to
    find this here.  All better now.

  * I did not sign up for the Australasian Logic Colloquium just held in
    Brisbane, November 6-7, 2023.  I did not see a program and the time zone
    differences were difficult.  However, the focus on logic, computation, and
    philosophy (philosophical logic?) is intriguing, along with LLC (language,
    logic, and computation in different venues).  There is also a Journal of
    Logic and Computation which is worth looking into.  Also, the ALC was
    sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL).

  * I need to determine what came out of the workshop on Logic for
    Undergraduate Computer Science.  I must track down the organizer and ask
    what happened.  The workshop was called LogTeach-22 (L4UCS).  I've asked
    the organizer and Moshe Vardi what happened.  There is no word.

  * I need to put the slides and paper on L4UCS on bib/ and let Edgar Daylight
    know about them and also the use of Manifestation in that paper.  I also
    need to figure out the AuthorizeIt thing with ACM. I could also put my own
    vitae here, now that I think about it.

  * In the refactoring, there needs to be a distinction between construction
    and management of the web materials versus job jar and diary regarding the
    subject matter, not the site construction.  There are clearly editorial
    cross-overs, but they are not so much construction as content, such as
    the observation about "manifestation" just below.  That's not unlike
    talking about material changes in code, even if it is about clarity or
    formatting.  This separation of concerns should be addressed in docEng
    also, even though that sort of goes meta there.

  * I completely dropped the valuable use of "manifestation" here.  That's an
    invaluable notion, along with interpretation, and I need to put it back
    into the account, including on the current docs/ front page.  Thanks to
    an exchange with Edgar Daylight that had me notice my neglect of that
    valuable term.

  * Explain the reference implementation(s) and notation(s) as the mainline,
    with mockups for proof-of-concept, demonstrations, and exercises.

  * Link to Golden Geek and to Numbering Peano, noting restoration of blogging
    and the web site.  SCRUB TO DOCS, MAKE PROVISIONAL

  * Docs will be moved here under docs/ in whatever authoring scheme I settle
    upon.  Miser-theory.info materials will be salvaged.  GitHub appears to be
    a more secure preservation mechanism.

   * See how to get a Wiki working here too.  I am concerned mainly about
    reflow and getting pages to work properly.  There is frustration between
    using GitHub versus Blogger at the moment.  The GitHub support is more
    desirable if view reflow works.  It seems to in the Wiki theme.

  * Review the efficacy of the various text files.  This may be too much
    subdivision.  Documentation might address this better.  Those files/topics
    might move accordingly.

  * Provide tombstones as materials are moved under the docs/ structure.

  * SCRUB: Move items to docs.txt when to be handled better with web pages.

  * Provide a little bit more information about what this is and where to
    find more about it.

  * Account for the use of .md as well as .txt files in this project.

  * Do we need engineering of the GitHub project (and document engineering)
    as distinct from the engineering of implementations.  We can handle this
    with a docs/construction mechanism.  I don't know about the construction
    structure of the code other than that.

  * Make the global change of orcmid repositories to have main as the default
    branch name, deprecating master (which will presumably redirect to main).

  * Review for changes needed in blog, wiki, and documentation pages.

  * From 2002-07-18 (#34.52) to 2002-07-27 (#34.65) there are many notes and
    they seem related to content at miser-theory.info, and an N020701. I need
    to figure out where to rescue that.  There's more on 2002-07-28
    (#34.69-70), (#34.73-78, 2002-07-29 to 07-30).  It seems that what I'm
    fussing about is <https://miser-theory.info/notes/2002/07/n020701.htm>.
    The site seems to have some breakage though.

  * On 2002-08-01 (#34.81) I am considering submission of a paper to STACS
    2003.  I was nowhere near ready and didn't go ahead with the idea.

  * On 2002-08-24 (#35.22-23) I found some interesting references and I'm
    uncertain what I tracked down, and whether any got into my bibliography.

  * On 2002-08-28 (#35.29-30) I raise some observations on oMiser 0.05 (no
    idea) and mention my discomfort with Böhm claiming a discriminator in
    the λ-calculus (since recanted).  Other musings turned out not to matter.
    (Later, Böhm would conclude that he was in error and correct his web
    page.)

  * On 2002-09-06 (#35.50 and #35.52) I get into the topic of "The
    Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics."  This led to my post on
    Einstein's observation. And here there are references to other articles
    where folks address the question, some apparently unaware of what
    Einstein had to say.  Now I need to find my own post on the topic. I refer
    to it in my paper on Logic for Computer Science undergraduates.

  * On 2002-10-18 (#35.86) I refer to N021000 in Well-Definedness. I wonder.

  * On 2002-10-26 (#35.91) I list some things that need notes, such as
    existence of mathematical entities, predicative sets, using Unicode,
    Gödel's self-referencing statement, and mumbles about tags in sMiser
    (which I suspect is lindies in oMiser)

  * On 2004-05-30 (#42.47) I come up with Astraendo for abstraction and use
    it on miser-theory.info.

  * On 2006-07-15 (#53.56) I realized that what I was calling caching somehow
    also attached implementation shortcuts on any Ob, something I would
    expect, along with having a COM-style vector, also having an applicative
    interpretation with acceleration.  That's not quite the same as having
    a COM pv on an ob-cell, so I really need to figure out how this all can
    work.

  * On 2006-09-03 (#54.71) I am talking about types but being confused, since
    I will come to functional types when I get to combinators.  Other types,
    like data types is a different matter, so interpretation and
    representation have to figure in.

  * THE MANIFEST IS INCORRECT. SORT THIS OUT.  It's for the repository, not
    for the docs/ folder.  For the docs/ folder, there is also docs.txt.  I
    ended up confusing myself, and now I understand this being a "tracker."
    The docs.txt file is just about managing documentation, but not content
    so much.  It does explain what miser.txt is doing here though.

  * On 2006-09-23 (#54.117) I make a note to write something about hosting
    on different platforms/languages.  I clearly haven't done that yet.  I was
    mostly thinking about .NET though.
