                               The Miser Project
                               =================

                        <https://github/orcmid/miser>

                         THE MISER PROJECT ON GITHUB
                         ---------------------------

           WEB SHADOW: <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/miser.txt>

                 THIS IS A SHADOW DERIVED FROM THE FILE AT
          <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/miser.txt>

          THIS SHADOW EXISTS TO CAPTURE TODOS THAT NOW APPLY ON
          THE WEB PRESENCE OF THE PROJECT.  WITH REGARD TO THE
          SOURCE-CONTROL OF THE SOFTWARE USING GIT AND GITHUB,
          CONSULT THE ORIGINAL.

    The Miser Project is being moved to GitHub in its entirety.  It is also
    being made web-centric, so that the authoritative text files of the
    project are housed in web folders from which orcmid.github.io/miser is
    published.  This proximity improves the likelihood that there is no
    maintenance drift between web presentations and authoritative text files.

    The main introduction and sketch is the page now  presented at the link
    <https://orcmid.github.io/miser>.  Technical details of the web presence
    construction are all connected via a scaffolding underpinning that
    commences at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/index.htm>.

TODO

  * I have no idea why I called this a "shadow" file. I need to look at the
    "original" in the full GitHub repository and figure out what I mean and
    where maintenance is intended to continue.

  * I did not sign up for the Australasian Logic Colloquium just held in
    Brisbane, November 6-7, 2023.  I did not see a program and the time zone
    differences were difficult.  However, the focus on logic, computation, and
    philosophy (philosophical logic?) is intriguing, along with LLC (language,
    logic, and computation in different venues).  There is also a Journal of
    Logic and Computation which is worth looking into.  Also, the ALC was
    sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL).

  * I need to determine what came out of the workshop on Logic for
    Undergraduate Computer Science.  I must track down the organizer and ask
    what happened.  The workshop was called LogTeach-22 (L4UCS).  I've asked
    the organizer and Moshe Vardi what happened.  There is no word.

  * I need to put the slides and paper on L4UCS on bib/ and let Edgar Daylight
    know about them and also the use of Manifestation in that paper.  I also
    need to figure out the AuthorizeIt thing with ACM. I could also put my own
    vitae here, now that I think about it.

  * In the refactoring, there needs to be a distinction between construction
    and management of the web materials versus job jar and diary regarding the
    subject matter, not the site construction.  There are clearly editorial
    cross-overs, but they are not so much construction as content, such as
    the observation about "manifestation" just below.  That's not unlike
    talking about material changes in code, even if it is about clarity or
    formatting.  This separation of concerns should be addressed in docEng
    also, even though that sort of goes meta there.

  * I completely dropped the valuable use of "manifestation" here.  That's an
    invaluable notion, along with interpretation, and I need to put it back
    into the account, including on the current docs/ front page.  Thanks to
    an exchange with Edgar Daylight that had me notice my neglect of that
    valuable term.

  * Explain the reference implementation(s) and notation(s) as the mainline,
    with mockups for proof-of-concept, demonstrations, and exercises.

  * Link to Golden Geek and to Numbering Peano, noting restoration of blogging
    and the web site.  SCRUB TO DOCS, MAKE PROVISIONAL

  * Docs will be moved here under docs/ in whatever authoring scheme I settle
    upon.  Miser-theory.info materials will be salvaged.  GitHub appears to be
    a more secure preservation mechanism.

   * See how to get a Wiki working here too.  I am concerned mainly about
    reflow and getting pages to work properly.  There is frustration between
    using GitHub versus Blogger at the moment.  The GitHub support is more
    desirable if view reflow works.  It seems to in the Wiki theme.

  * Review the efficacy of the various text files.  This may be too much
    subdivision.  Documentation might address this better.  Those files/topics
    might move accordingly.
