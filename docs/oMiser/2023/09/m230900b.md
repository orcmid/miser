## Cases

There are 4 flavors of HashFlag creation:

```text
  〈individual-name〉 ::= 〈plane-lindy〉 | ?〈plane-lindy〉
                    |  〈primitive〉   | ?〈primitive〉
```

1. Individuals: The Hash for ordinary individuals is based on the name of the
    individual in oFrugal syntax
    \[[ob-exp](../../../oFrugal/ob-exp.txt):TERMS\]. All but 〈primitive〉 are classified as symbolic-forms.  The ?-prefixed forms are distinct are
    provided to allow an application (namely oFrugal) to continue despite
    certain defects in the script (cf.
    \[[obaptheory](../../../obap/obaptheory.txt): Obap3)\]).

2. Pairs: The Hash of of a pair is a function of the HashFlags of the two
   components.

3. Enclosures: The Hash of an enclosure is a function of the HashFlag of the
   constituent.

4. Synthetics: The Hash of a synthetic individual is a function of the
   HashFlag of the ob-cell providing the definition of the synthetic as established in [obapx](../../../obapx).

## Critical Invariance

In the case of individuals, including extension to synthetics, the uniqueness
of individuals has to be preserved and duplication must be prevented.  Any
collision of Hashtags for individuals must be resolved simply by the ob-cell
locations being different.

It is unnecessary to inspect anything about the creation of an individual to
rely on its uniqueness.

## External Identifiability

Every ob has a canonical Form (CFob).  To report the CFob of an ob, the
structure is presented in a formula for nested pairings and enclosures.
Named individuals are identified by their namings.

In the oMiser implementation, ob-cells corresponding to named individuals
are proximate to strings of their unique individual names.  The cells can be
accessed by searching on their names.  Given the ob-cell of a particular
individual, its unique name can be retrieved directly.  The API functions for
those actions are the means by which oFrugal, and any other applications, can
establish individuals and also determine the names associated with given
individuals.

Given this condition on ob-cells, it is important that any hash-table changes
that occur in connection with insertions and (potentially) deletion of
hash table entries never move an ob-cell which is still accessible by its
address from any other reachable ob-cell.

The situation with synthetic individuals is similar except that a Synthetic
has a distinct ob as its applicative interpretation and, in effect, as its
name. Synthetics must also not be duplicated. That means subjecting them
to hash-table lookups as well. In this case, the Hash from the synthetic's
HashTag should be useful. Extended canonical forms (CFobx) carry provisions
for the text presentation of Synthetics as such individuals are introduced.

In the interesting case that there is already such a Synthetic as one being introduced, with the identical applicative interpretation, the
already-established one shall prevail, just as for the introduction of any
other named individual.
