This topic covers the introduction of extended applicative interpretations
as additions to the obap specification.  Implementation in computational
manifestation is addressed as part of [oMiser](../oMiser) and
[oFrugal](../oFrugal) coverage.  Perhaps the most-evident impact of these
extensions is on the determination of canonical forms.  There are dramatic
alterations required for [CFob](../ob/CFob.txt).

## The Extension Principle

The approach to extensions involves establishment of ***individuals*** having
special applicative interpretations.  They remain distinguishable while
having specific interpretations, as if they are new/derived primitives.

Extensions are intended to provide the means by which oMiser can operate in
an interactive or coordinated manner such as communication with
seemingly-external/-separate entities.  Having a pseudo-random generator of
particular ob patterns is an example, as are other cases where the possession
of a state is understood, whether or not such state is completely known.

Extensions shall preserves immutability and distinguishability of individuals.
It is part of the Miser Project research agenda that this be strived for and
any ultimate limitations be understood.

## An Illustrative Conservative Extension

For oMiser, an extension is conservative if everything the extension
introduces can be accomplished without it.  In pragmatic terms, the extension
may afford more expressibility in use of oMiser (and thereby, oFrugal) and
there may also be useful improvements in operational performance.

Such an extension
[under consideration](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/discussions/47) consists
of functions that introduce individuals having specified scripts as their
applicative interpretations.

### The proc/def extension

In the case of the **proc** extension, the idea is that **proc**(_p_) will be
an individual such that obapx.ap(**proc**(_p_), _x_) is the same as
obap.ap(_p_, _x_).  There are two consequences.

First, **proc**(_p_) is an individual and the script is generally not exposed.
λ-abstraction does not penetrate into _p_ although it is possible to
abstract **proc**(_p_) itself, just as non-primitive individuals can be
so-abstracted.

Pragmatically, _p_ is not entirely hidden, since

**proc**(_p_) = **proc**(_q_) ⇔ _p_ = _q_

and the inverse of **proc**, **dev**, is also introduced:

**dev**(**proc**(_p_)) = _p_

If _s_ is _not_ **proc**(_p_) for some _p_, then

**dev**(_s_) = _s_

The specific individuals whose applicative interpretations correspond to
**proc** and **def** are `obapx.proc` and `obapx.def`.  That is,

- obapx.ap(`obapx.proc`, _p_) = **proc**(_p_)
- obapx.ap(`obapx.def`, _s_) = **def**(_s_)

To signify the presence of a **proc** individual in a CFob (and hence in
oFrugalese), a specific notation is required to signify the defined **proc**.
It's proposed to write the CFob of **proc**(_p_) in a special form such as
`proc!`(CFob of _p_).

### Practical considerations

The **proc**/**def** arrangement provides a means, in oMiser, for procedurally
determining whether an individual is a **proc** or not.  It is also the case,
for oMiser, that comparison of individuals is near-instantaneous and so is
any **def**(_s_) = _s_ determination.

It may also be the case that occurrence of **proc**(_s_) is also a hint for
acceleration of the applicative interpretation of _s_ in oMiser.  It may be
possible to over-use this implementation-dependent facility, however.

The **proc**/**dev** pattern will be adaptable to other situations that may
arise in expanding the computational utility of oMiser operations.  These will
all be pragmatic (and mathematically engineered) features.

## Quasi-Conservative Extensions

In computational settings, there are practical needs for facilities that do
not appear to fit the conservative-extension pattern of **proc**/**def**.
Most examples involve the idea of alterable state, including ones where state
cannot be entirely known, devolving to observable effects instead.

In no case are individuals ever changed.  Applicative interpretations will
be the same, with changes reflected in the determination of a separate
distinct individual as the derived result.  The mathematical challenge is
preservation of well-definedness.  Illustration and navigation of these
challenges will be expanded upon as specific extensions are devised.

## Unfathomable Cases

There may be features considered to be extensions that defy characterization
as mathematically-determined.  They may be contingent on unknown reality and
will perhaps be disqualified from oMiser.  To the degree that such entitites
are tolerated as a practical requirement, it is of interest to find ways to
quarantine such impurities, isolating their scope and impact from the
applicability of mathematical reasoning (or, sadly, vice versa).
