## 1. Basic Principal

In the *provisional* x64 ob-cell storage structure for every ob, there is a
32-bit (4-byte) word containing a 24-bit (3-byte) Hash value and an
8-bit (1-byte) Flag field. The combination is designated as the HashFlag
field of the ob-cell.

- The Flag field is an invariant of the structural properties of an ob. When
HashFlags are the same, the compared ob-cells have identical Flag fields.

- Individuals are never duplicated.  Two references to ob-cells that are
known to be for individuals will be to different individuals if the ob-cell
locations are different, despite any collision of Hash Values.

- Hash values are not based on locations or other characteristics of ob-cells
apart from the structural characteristics of the ob and the determination of
hash values for individuals from known information (such as a lindy's name)
and for composed obs, the HashFlags of components.

## 2. Open Questions

Both analysis and experimentation is required, including by instrumentation of the oMiser implementation.

- What is an usable but simple hashing algorithm for the Hash of an ob pair
from the HashFlags of the components?

- Are 24-bit (3-byte) Hash fields good enough? That permits
16,777,215 values (0 being excluded).  Are the expected collisions tolerable?

- Are HashFlags too costly?  The derivation of a Hash for every introduction
  of a new ob-cell adds to the computational cost of those actions.  When
  performed as part of oFrugal When performed in the course of an
  application, especially for short-lived ob-cells that will never be exposed
  through the API, it must be determined how much this activity
  (along with memory management) can be kept low-cost.

- And is it wasteful for no short-term gain?  There is a related consideration
  with regard to short-lived ob-cells, ones that are transient intermediate results in applicative operations. For some
  time I have wanted to leave initial creations of ob-cells on the run-time
  stack, simply dropping them by a retreat of the stack if not swept into a
  longer-lived storage generation.  In that case, perhaps even computation of
  hashes (and actions on reference counts?) might be deferred until a sweep.
    This is all speculative. Henry Baker has done something similar in
  [Chicken Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/) and his clever C Language
  approach with continuations has been described at
  <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/214448.214454>.

## 3. Hints?

There are some places to look farther.

- It turns this is not a new problem with many small elements, such as
  ob-cells, that was resolved in the case of Microsoft Excel economizing
  on spreadsheet cells even though COM interfaces were introduced.

- Henry Baker has found economy of short-lived small objects using the runtime
  hardware stack.  The technique is used in
  [Chicken Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/) and his clever C Language
  approach is described at
  [Baker1995](https://orcmid.github.io/bib/compsci.htm#Baker1995) and earlier.
