## Placeholder

This will be populated from (#68.9-10 and links from there).

This is strictly about the XML format that we are after.  The idea is that it
provide a kind of reverse-Polish loading scheme with preservation of multiple
links to the same ob-cell.

This might not be appropriate for quick-saving and loading as if from backups.

The use of an OPC/ODF Package with compression and possible signing/encryption
is also of interest in a persistent form.

Those options might be separate.  The key feature that has to be established
is creating a topological sorting that has an ob-cell established prior to
all cells that refer to it and also provides a tag that all but the chosen
one can use to refer to it.  This should work without forward references, if
not too hard.  Or maybe we take our chances with program points.

It's really all up in the air.
