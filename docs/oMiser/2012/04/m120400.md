## Placeholder

Consideration of an XML-based external format was noted starting on
2012-04-14 (#68.9).  The idea is to use a custom XML parser and output
processor that effectively captures a reverse-Polish expression of obs
that can be loaded and allocated quickly.

The base case is simple export of a complete single Ob in an XML format.
Tagging of elements on load can be used when an ob-cell is referenced from
more than one "parent".  We do not want to unnecessarily duplicate what were
originally reached from more than one ob-cell.

[2025-11-20: I think HashFlags would be checked on reloading.  I don't think
it goes with the need for speed to do anything about HashFlag collisions, or
even checking for them. For items carried in the MOb directory, that will
happen though.]

[2025-11-20: It is necessary to do a topological sort to have a reverse-
Polish order for re-entry.  I need to get farther into the Stanford GraphBase
to accomplish that and establish that shared branches are handled properly.
I was thinking of something like program points for reducing redundancy. This
may be a tricky thing to accomplish in the topographical sort, but it is
necessary to reduce duplicates.  There is then the serial ordering.  This
reminds me of CPM methods on project trees or even things like Gant charts.]

[2025-11-20: Although one can always reload from oFrugal "source" and store
oFrugal responses as source, the idea is also to be able to save and share/
restore what seem to be more-efficient forms. It might also be the case, in
order to save quickly, that the topological sort be done off-line from
oFrugal.  This is about saving and restoring as well as sharing in a kind of
binary form.  I should find out what was done for this with respect to LISP.]
