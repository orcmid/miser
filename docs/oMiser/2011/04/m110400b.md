## PlaceHolder

This page will describe the Linear Hashing procedure.  There will be a tie-in
with the oMiser Memory Management scheme although garbage collection should
be invisible.

The interesting connections are going to be between buckets, what the list
items are (and they have their full hashes so "rehashing" is a trivial
action) and what are the components (1) that don't have to be moved when
the hash-table entry moves and (2) that honor generation recognitions for any
garbage collection, and (3) preserve ¶ in any important way.

The above appears to be over-constraining and that has to be figured out. Some
of it isn't about the linear hashing specifically, but does involve
interaction with memory management and generational garbage collection.

## Critical Invariance

Yup, need to work that out.

Meanwhile, there is an important clarification to the nomenclature used for
Linear Hashing.  For the MOb, items *have* Hash values of at least 24 bits.
This is part of the ob-cell design and so the full HashFlag value is
available in distinguishing the objects in a single MOb bucket.  Because the
hash value is part of the item, rehashing does not occur.  The bucket can
change (or not) as the Linear Hashing mask changes with expansions and
contractions of the MOb.

There can still be collisions, however, and we need something else to resolve
them.  It might be consultation of an actual key, in the case of a lindy of
any flavor (including primitives).  The trickier parts may be synthetics,
since they are anonymous in some manner.  There will have to be something that
does distinguish them, and the definition may be what needs to be compared.
Bindings fall into this category also.

A side question with respect to bindings is if there is a way to recover the
binding in a pretty-printing or an oFrugal level dump.  It will definitely
matter in save-restore dumps and might as well in MObPack exports, so long
as no colliding use might happen.  Have to watch out for that problem.

Duh!!! It might be valuable to have synthetics be named somehow also.  That
s a possible side question.

I invite discussion about Miser Project topics in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/issues).  There are also
relevant [projects](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/projects?type=classic)
from time to time.
