## 1. Overview

oMiser provides a directory, the MOb, that is the interface between
applications, such as oFrugal, and the representations of currently-accessible
Ob-domain entities: primitive obs, named obs (such as those for literal
symbols), and those obs reachable by binding names.

The MOb is the means by which identifiable entities are accessed and by
which new ones are established for future usage.

There is also a special kind of individual, a synthetic, that is anonymous but
recorded in the MOb to preserve its unique definition.

When an oMiser instance is established for operation and use, an IMOb COM
interface returned for is returned for accessing MOb items and operating with
those items by their COM interfaces.

## 1. Services of the MOb Interface

The following different requests can be made by use of the IMOb interface:

- Find Primitives with case-insensitive names beginning with ".".  If the
  primitive exists, an interface to the individual is returned.  If there
  is no such `.name` primitive, the alternative lindy `?.name` is used and an exception is noted.

- Find Individuals by their lindy names.  If a name has not been used
  yet, an individual will be created.  In either case, an interface is
  supplied.

- Establish an ob as the values of a "^name" (or "^^") binding name.

- Find obs defined to have binding names beginning with "^" (including "^^").
  If such a binding is established, an interface to the ob-cell of the
  definition is supplied.  If there is no such `^name`-defined ob
  the alternative lindy `?name` is used and an exception is noted.  The
  binding name "^^" is always defined and is initially ob `.NIL`.

- Find the ob defined by the special `?name` binding name.  If there is (now)
  a definition for  `^name`, that definition is returned.  Otherwise, the
  result is the same as when `^name` is not defined.

All of the situations were obs are supplied or returned, this is via their
COM interfaces.

These are the the only externally-usable services of the MOb apart from ones
available for import and export MOb data, if needed.  Operations with obs
themselves are obtained via ob-cell interfaces.


## 2. Linear Hashing

A Linear Hashing Technique is used to record objects in the MOb and to locate
them by searching on computed hash values.

With Linear Hashing the MOb directory can start with a relatively-small
number of buckets -- blocks of storage each set up for any items having a
subset of possible hash values.  When buckets start growing to be full, the
buckets are quietly split into two buckets each, now each designated for half
of the hash-value range of the original bucket.  Roughly have of the items in
the original bucket will be moved into the new one, based on the new ranges.
This continues progressively as more items are introduced into the MOb.

The appeal for oMiser is the moving of items into an added bucket does not
require any recomputation of hashes.  In the MOb, items carry their full hash
values and the determination of which ones to move is straightforward.  Also,
the ob-cell that the MOb item leads to does not move, only the MOb item used
for finding it, minimizing any need to reorganize deeper into the storage of
ob-cells.

## 3. MOb Usage Considerations

The primary MOb usage, apart from definitions of binding names, is in the
recording of and access to named individuals.  The benefit of both cases
is the permanent retention of those items whether or not there are any
immediate uses of the corresponding obs.  The MOb is the means of holding
their availability and avoiding unnecessary recreation of items.

There are anonymous individuals that are also managed using the MOb even
though unreachable by the MOb-exposed services. Anonymous cases support
preservation of uniqueness of ob-cells for internally-derived anymous
individuals.  Technically, those do not require retention if no longer
internally reached, but prospective duplicate effort is avoided.

Early in the growth of the MOb, collisions will be the norm and there needs
to be some clean way to handle them before splitting and also in the process
of splitting.  There is some (rather complicated) analysis on the topic
[Underwood2026](https://orcmid.github.io/bib/compsci.htm#Underwood2026) and
resources on the topic need to be gathered, especially
[Farach-Colton2025](https://orcmid.github.io/bib/compsci.htm#Farach-Colton2025).

There will also be need for some good simulations and instrumentation in
oMiser prototyping to ascertain what the predictable behaviors are and what
optimization strategems are generally effective.
