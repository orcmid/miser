## Tentative Overview: Keeping All the Balls in the Air

A Linear Hashing Technique is envisioned to provide access to those oMiser
objects that will be locatable via a hash-based search, establishing the MOb
Directory for that purpose.

Although every ob-cell has a HashFlag value, that does not necessarily make
it possible that an ob-cell can be searched by it's HashFlag in the MOb.  The
HashFlag has an often-independent usage solely for optimizing comparisons and,
perhaps, reducing occurrence of different ob-cells for exactly the same Ob
manifestation.

The critical MOb usage is in the recording of individuals, because generally
they are all named.  Synthetics are anonymous and in that case they are still
closely-coupled into the MOb in order to manage their lifetimes and their
connection to defining material.

Since every ob-cell has an applicative interpretation, that is another case
for their being associated information and having a place where that ties into
the MOb for lifecyle management of the ob-cell and associated data as well,
akin to synthetics but not being individuals.  And perhaps having such
material would require being moved out of heap-0 in the first place.  This
could all be very interesting.  And maybe fragile.

There is a tie-in to overall oMiser memory management, especially with
generational garbage collection. In preparing to scrub a heap-0 by retreating
the process stack, it is necessary to identify and move those ob-cells that
are still reachable, including from the MOb.

There is also a middle case to consider.  Heap-0 ob-cells should not have
associated other date (as for synthetics and ob-cells having accerators),
because those then have to be found to avoid memory-leaking associated data.
Because the whole idea of Heap-0 is to rapidly dispense with short-lived
objects, we would like to not have to pay attention to longer-live ob-cells
created in heap-0 until they need to be preserved in a deeper generation.

So, it would seem, the existence of associated date implies occurrence in the
MOb, and there's some associated lifecycle management principles that allow
such objects to be swept through generations so long as them remain
accessible, not just being in the MOb.  Endurance through generations has to
work somehow, ideally without making much material move around.  We need an
easy way to know what reachable objects live in a given generation so they can
be swept out as part of retreating that generation or, alternatively, simply
keeping them alive in the generation they occupy.

It's unclear how one reorganizes or garbage collects generations other than
heap-0.  It might be that is handled as part of export and reloading. This
and other considerations need to be worked out here.

There will also be need for some good simulations and instrumentation in
oMiser prototyping to ascertain what the predictable behaviors are and what
optimization strategems are generally effective.
