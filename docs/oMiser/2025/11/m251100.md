## Place-Holder

This topic addresses the special memory-management procedures for the oMiser
representation of Obs and structures that accompany the computational model.

A special usage is related to dynamically-created ob-cells, their storage, and
and their generational management and consolidation: garbage-collection, in
which the run-time procedure stack is to be used as heap-0 for the rapid
creation and disposal of short-lived objects.

The generational management also works in preserving longer-lived objects
that also arise on the run-time stack and in other heaps.  There need to be
aging schemes by which one can readily determine what ob-cells in any heap
need to be preserved in an older generation as part of clearing a younger one.

Finally, there is management of objects that are held on behalf of external
or companion purposes. An easy case is symbolic lindies that are created via
the oMiser API (and especially by oFrugal's usage of that API).  This leads
to the need for the MOb directory that also grows and shrinks in important
ways.

There are interdependencies/interactions between MOb, ob-cells, the connection
of companion materials (accelerators or synthetic definitions) and the
life-cycle management and garbage-collection/generation-handling of
dynamically generated, moved, and destroyed materials.

All of that is to be collected/cordinated under this topic.
