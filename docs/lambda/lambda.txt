NOTES AND TODO

 * On 2006-09-19 (#54.106-108), while at ICFP, I start writing Frugalese for
   is-member(x) L and getting to is-member(x) and then λx rec.ismemx λL (...)
   which just doesn't look right.  I do remark that it is tail-recursive
   though.  I'm  after getting recursion right.

 * On 2006-09-20 (#54.109-111) I continue fussing with Frugalese and getting
   combinators out of it in the sense that the oMiser representations of them
   preserve functional type and that works.  I don't have it explained that
   well though.
