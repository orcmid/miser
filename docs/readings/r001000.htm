<blockquote>

<p align="left">I have been saying that Miser is a model, and I now need to be 
rigorous about it.&nbsp; And I would like to keep as much harmony with the use 
of the term in mathematical logic and also in science.</p>
  

<p align="left">Using the index, we have a mention in footnote 451 on p.287 (in 
§48.22).&nbsp; This relates to a system, G, having enumerably infinite models, 
and those having enumerably infinite extensions.</p>
  

<p align="left">In §55, on postulate theory, Church takes this apart.</p>
  

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p align="left">When a system of postulates is used as basis for the 
		formal treatment of some mathematical theory, the postulates have to be 
		thought of as added to an underlying logic.<br>
      Viz., for Miser as a theory, there is an underlying logic to which the 
		particular postulates and definitions are added.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">For the precise syntactical definition of the particular 
		theory, it is necessary to state not only the specific mathematical 
		postulates but also a formalization of the underlying logic.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The class of theorems belonging to the theory in question 
		is determined by both the postulates and the underlying logic.</li>
  </ol>
  <p align="left">Church looks at the interplay of these.&nbsp; He is careful in 
	forming theories to not use constants but to have <b><i>uninterpreted</i></b>
  postulates.&nbsp; He will then speak of interpretations of the theory (e.g., 
	for arithmetic and for a number theory (<i>n</i>-th order arithmetic).</p>
  <p align="left">Church considers that there is a representing form of 
	postulates in which it is expressed as a universal closure (that is, with no 
	free variables, or at least no free variables of a certain kind), and it is 
	added to a <b>functional calculus </b>(defined earlier) of the least order 
	in which all of the representing forms are well-formed.</p>
  <p align="left">A model of the postulates, in this case, is a non-empty domain 
	of individuals together with a system of values of the free variables of the 
	representing form which satisfy the postulates simultaneously in the domain 
	of individuals.</p>
  <p align="left">We now get to a very interesting place.&nbsp; Consider a 
	propositional form in the system.&nbsp; This form is a consequence of the 
	postulates if it is true in every model of the postulates.</p>
  <p align="left">The mathematical theory can be considered to be all of the 
	propositions (within the system) that are consequences of the postulates.&nbsp; 
	[This inherently includes the postulates themselves.]</p>
  <p align="left">Two models of a system of postulates are said to be isomorphic 
	if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two domains of 
	individuals of the models, such that the assignments of free variables 
	always correspond between the two models.</p>
  <p align="left">A system of postulates is considered categorical if all of its 
	models are isomorphic.</p>
</blockquote>

Theory, Model, and Interpretation</a></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">It looks like what I have to deal with here is a confluence of 
	system, theory, model, and interpretation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Church&#39;s sense of interpretation is that used now in 
	mathematical logic.&nbsp; It would appear that his sense of model also 
	agrees.&nbsp; I need to now look at other sources to determine how to 
	reconcile my sense of theories as modeling something versus theories having 
	models.</p>
