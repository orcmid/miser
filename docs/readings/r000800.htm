<h3>Demonstration of the Diagonal Argument for non-computable functions 
[Introduction, 1, p.xvii]</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we generate all procedures in order of increasing length, and let E[i] 
be the ith procedure.</p>

  <p>We will say that&nbsp;f[i](x) is the function that E[i] computes.</p>

  <p>Now let g(x) = f[x](x)+1</p>

  <p>For no value of i is it the case that g(x) = f[i](x).</p>

  <p>Suppose that it was,&nbsp; then</p>

  <p>there is some i0 such that g(x) = f[i0](x).</p>

  <p>So f[i0](x) = f[x](x)+1 by definition of g(x)</p>

  <p>and so it must also be true for x = i0,</p>

  <p>f[i0](i0) = f[i0](i0)+1, which is a contradiction.</p>

  <p>So no procedure in the E[i] has as its function, g(x).&nbsp; But all of the 
	effective procedures are in E[i].&nbsp; So g(x) is not effectively 
	computable.</p>

  <p>This establishes the existence of functions that are not effectively 
	calculable.&nbsp; g(x) is not computable.</p>

  <p>In the discussion of this result, Davis digs into how the the contradiction 
	arises.&nbsp; The suspect is the supposition that one can create an 
	enumeration of the effective procedures in the first place!&nbsp; (Sort of 
	the Chinese Room flaw.)&nbsp; That is, the defect is in the hypothesized E[i].</p>

  <p><b>Miser Note:</b></p>

<p><b>2000-08-09 (orcmid)</b>.&nbsp; It is also important to differentiate, 
here, the difference between the computable functions and the effective 
procedures.&nbsp; Notice that there may be many effective procedures for the 
same function.&nbsp; That is, there is no requirement that the correspondence be 
one-to-one.&nbsp; The other thing to notice is that the E[i], if they could be 
created, would be countable (the [i] assures that).&nbsp; So even if we made the 
P[i] be the set of procedures in some language (not necessarily ones 
corresponding to computable functions), the E are a subset of the P.&nbsp; It 
should be no surprise that there are far more functions than can be fit into 
that set, so there must be functions that are not computable by an argument on 
cardinality alone.</p>

<p>In coming up with a universal machine, there is something to pay attention to 
here.&nbsp; We want the P[i] that we arrive at to have all the E[i] that there 
can be (in the system of the given universal machine), and have them correspond 
to all the computable functions there are, with none missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Notations [Introduction, 3]</h3>

  <h4>3.1 Tuples</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tuples are written like (3,2,7), with (1,2) for pairs.&nbsp; I would prefer 
	[3,2,7] and [1,2] because I don&#39;t want to make any confusion with ordinary 
	use of parentheses, especially for the arguments of functions.&nbsp; (See 
	3.3, below.)</p>

  <p>Characteristic of <i>n</i>-tuples is that n-tuple identity is equivalent to 
	identity of the corresponding elements.</p>

  <p>Notation for general <i>n</i>-tuples is a kind of power notation that seems 
	to be syntactical, using <b>x</b><sup>(<i>n</i>)</sup> to mean x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>, 
	..., x<sub><i>n</i></sub>.&nbsp; It is not clear whether this is 
	metalanguage or something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a tendency to write a tuple 
	without the outer parentheses.</p>

  <p>The fonts used for these are peculiar, and the convention seems to be a 
	formal one.&nbsp; We may end up needing to restate this to deal with 
	applicative notation and free-standing construction of tuples.</p>

</blockquote>

  <h4>3.2 Sets</h4>

<blockquote>

  <p>Uses membership, sets of <i>n</i>-tuples (for fixed <i>n</i>), and uses a 
	simple subset symbol but does not mean proper subset.&nbsp; Empty set is 
	symbolized by a little phi, ø, and the empty set is a subset of every set.</p>

  <p><b>Miser Note</b>: 2000-08-09 (orcmid)&nbsp; We need to do something about 
	notation and HTML here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Iverson solution for J does not seem 
	acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp; We want something that can translate well, but not 
	require mathematical typography.</p>

  <p>Notice that the empty set is simply a constant object, and we can use <span style="font-variant: small-caps">
	empty</span>
  if need be.&nbsp; Or <b>empty</b> if that is more appropriate.&nbsp; It is 
	important to avoid confusion with programming and formal examples.&nbsp; A 
	sans-serif font might help, if we could count on it being available to 
	people.&nbsp; Also, we need to avoid the presumption that we are using a 
	programming notation.</p>

  <p>For membership, we can have <i>m</i> <b>member-of</b> <i>S</i>, and in 
	Frugal notation (not the language), we will have it be convenient to write <b>
	is-member</b>(<i>m</i>)
  <i>S </i>instead, to be read in the same sense.</p>

  <p>For subsets, we can represent <i>R</i> <b>included-in</b> <i>S</i>&nbsp; by 
	the notation <b>is-included</b>(<i>R</i>) <i>S</i>.</p>

  <p>Similar translations lead to&nbsp; <b>union</b>(<i>R</i>) <i>S</i>, <b>
	intersection</b>(<i>R</i>)
  <i>S</i>, and <b>complement</b> <i>R</i>.&nbsp; Note that complement depends 
	on knowing the universe of sets that we have in our hands.&nbsp; These 
	functions are all defined on sets of n-tuples and the implicit domain is 
	omitted.&nbsp; That is, we don&#39;t have to write <b>complement</b><sub><i>n</i></sub>, 
	but it needs to be understood in many contexts.&nbsp; (And <b>empty</b> is 
	included in the domain and the range.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <h4>3.3 Functions</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Considers functions on <i>n</i>-tuples of natural numbers.&nbsp; That is 
	how the <i>n</i>-tuple notation comes into play.&nbsp; Treats sets of <i>n</i>-tuples 
	as domains, then functions on these domains to integers.&nbsp; So functions 
	are defined on domains of <i>n</i>-tuples, with fixed <i>n</i>.&nbsp; These 
	can be the Cartesian product on the Natural numbers, or they can be subsets 
	of the Cartesians.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A function is total if its domain is the Cartesian.</p>

  <p>division and subtraction are defined only on the natural numbers, so they 
	have restricted domains.</p>

  <p>The characteristic function of a set is a total n-ary function one that 
	produces 0 if the argument n-tuple is a member of some set S, and 1 
	otherwise.&nbsp; This function is also called C<sub>S</sub> or, for Miser, <b>
	C</b> <i>S</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Note the reversal from the usual sense of Boolean values.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t 
	matter of course, because one can make the dual of this function as well.</p>

  <p>Does some cute things on <b>C</b>(<b>union</b>(<i>R</i>) <i>S</i>) = <b>C</b>(<i>R</i>) 
	× <b>C</b>(<i>S</i>)</p>

  <p><b>C</b>(<b>intersection</b>(<i>R</i>) <i>S</i>) = <b>C</b>(<i>R</i>) + <b>
	C</b>(<i>S</i>) -
  <b>C</b>(<i>R</i>)×<b>C</b>(<i>S</i>)</p>

  <p><b>C</b>(<b>complement</b> <i>R</i>) = 1 - <b>C</b>(<i>R</i>)</p>

  <p>It will be a matter of interest whether the characteristic function of a 
	given set is computable.&nbsp; This is a way to formulate unsolvability.</p>

  <p><b>2000-08-16:</b> To be precise, as is our wont for Miser, we will 
	probably have to make the order of a domain explicit, and so with the 
	Characteristic Function of a set.&nbsp; This limitation is related to 
	wanting to be very careful around enumeration and enumerability issues.</p>

</blockquote>

  <h4>3.4 Statements (propositions)</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>The propositional logic of statements assumes statements that assert 
	propositions that must be either <b> true</b> or <b>false</b>.&nbsp; For <i>
	statements</i>, we have&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>p</i> <b>and</b> <i>q</i>, <i>p</i> <b>or</b> <i>q</i>, and <b>not</b> <i>
	p</i>.</p>

  <p><b>2000-08-16: </b>It is important here that the propositions are about 
	statements.&nbsp; That is, when we say that a statement &quot;is&quot; <i>p</i>
  <b>and</b> <i>q</i>, this can be taken as a semantic observation about the 
	form (i.e., the <i>sense</i>) of a statement.&nbsp; It does not mean that 
	the statement&#39;s literal expression is <i>p</i> <b>and</b> <i>q</i>.&nbsp; 
	When we deal with formal logic, using propositional logic, we will look at 
	is as if the sense-form is then all we have.&nbsp; However, there could be 
	many interpretations of these forms in statements that do not resemble the 
	sense-forms, but have agreed interpretations as such.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This is going to be important to us when we look at how language is dealt 
	with in computational systems, and we look at the limitations that we employ 
	to create a computational logic.</p>

  <p>For now, it is important to understand that propositions in the form used 
	in propositional algebra are the consequence of analysis of statements as to 
	their sense.&nbsp; Then we apply propositional logic to arrive at new 
	propositional forms that can be reinterpreted in natural language, where we 
	preserve fixed senses of the constituent statements <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, ... 
	throughout.&nbsp; This is the sense in which propositional logic <i>applies</i>
  to statements.</p>

</blockquote>

  <h4>3.5 Predicates</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>2000-08-16:</b> Predicates are viewed by Davis as having interpretations 
	as statements upon substitution of particulars for its free variables.&nbsp; 
	The predicate then becomes a (propositional) statement.&nbsp; We can examine 
	whether what we have said, above, about sense-forms holds.&nbsp; In the 
	example of P(x,y) being the predicate for the statement <i>x</i> = <i>y</i> 
	+ 3, it would seem to be so.</p>

</blockquote>
