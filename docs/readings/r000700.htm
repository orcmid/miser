<h2 align="left">2000-07-18: Initial Notes - How Lambda-Calculus and Combinatory
Algebra Figure in Miser</h2>
  

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b>2000-07-18 (orcmid)</b>: 
	<a href="theory.htm#Barendregt1981">This</a>
  was the only serious
        lambda-calculus book that I kept in preparing to move to Italy in
        September, 1999. So I am mining it here for combinatory logic
  (CL).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="left">Miser Representation of Combinatory Logic</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">I will demonstrate that programs for
        the Miser Engine represent combinatory logic, so combinatory algebra is
        useable for discussion of an exploration of computational completeness.
        The CL is equivalent to the closed-form lambda calculus (no free
        variables) which is equivalent to the set of recursive functions which
        is equivalent to what is computable. What's cool about Miser is it
        provides a pretty direct access to CL without presuming CL as primitive.
        That is, CL is represented, and this raises some interesting things
        about that and about representing mathematical structures by computer, generally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="left">Establishing Valid Interpretation of Combinatory Logic in Miser</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">My concern is as follows. If the Miser Engine
        evaluation mechanism provides a <i>valid</i> interpretation of CL, then
        all of the results of CL apply and can be used to simplify formulae,
        etc., to reduce and find equivalences, etc. Likewise, the lambda
        calculus can also be used, since by having CL as a model, the Miser
        Engine also has the computable part of the lambda calculus as a model.
        So all theorems and results about CL and the computable lambda calculus
        are results about the Miser Engine.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">If I find that there are exceptions, I need to
        figure out how to repair the interpretation or else I may have to build
        a derivative of CL that accounts for them. I would much rather find that
        the interpretation is sound and valid. So I need to do some theory work
        to satisfy myself about that.</p>
  <p align="left">My readings have involved mining in here enough
        to put sticky notes on pages where there is relevant material.</p>
  <p align="left">The idea is not that people should have to
        master this stuff. I need to master enough of it so that I can rely on
        the results of this theoretical work in an informal development that is
        still supported by the heavier theory. I want to just appeal to it,
        discuss it informally, and point people to the main bodies of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 align="left">Dancing on the Edge of Computability</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Something I have to work out is the problem of
        undefined (or non-reducible forms) that come up. These are equivalent to
        programs that don't terminate. It is fine to have them, of course -- you
        can't have a universal computer without termination problems -- but I
        need to make sure that the representation of CL squares with the theory
        of CL in this area. In particular, I am going to be very rigorous around
        not allowing program simplifications that will eliminate undefined
        parts. (This is like avoiding the classic mistakes that come up if you
        simplify formulae involving divisions and neglect the problem of there
        being a potentially-0-valued denominator in the original form that was
        inadvertently simplified out.)</p>
