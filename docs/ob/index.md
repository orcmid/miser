## Initial Placeholder

The elaboration of the fundamental structure,‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉, is
provided here.  Essential characteristics of obs and reasoning (in Ot)
about functions (thereby in Of) on obs are explained and expanded upon.

There is also introduction of uninterpreted symbols, the literal
individuals (lindies) that have no intrinsic significance.  Lindies are
valuable in devising data representations and in [oFrugal](../oFrugal)
expression of [obap](../obap) applicative-operation scripts.

## Catalog (Provisional)

### Work-in-Progress

Current activity involves migration of text files from other areas of the
repository to the web-based public face of the repository.  While migration
is underway, there are placeholder links to raw materials and notes, including
text files.

### Provisional Content

Authoritative material is maintained in text files that can be downloaded
and consulted independent of the GitHub repository and availability on the
Internet via web pages.  There will be improved organization and web materials
as development proceeds.

There are also text notes on topics that are being researched prior to
resolution and documentation in web materials.

### Archival Materials

A 2018-2019 series of blog posts provides original narratives on the
‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉structure.  These will be supplanted under this Miser
Project topic over time.

 - [Miser Project: Hark! Is That a Theory I see Before Me?](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/07/miser-project-hark-is-that-theory-i-see.html) 2018-07-10
 - [Miser Project: ‹ob› Primitive Functions](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/08/miser-project-ob-primitive-functions.html) 2018-08-26
 - [Miser Project: Narrowing ‹ob› for Computational Interpretation](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/09/miser-project-narrowing-ob-for.html) 2018-09-05
 - [Miser Project: Representing Data as obs](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/11/miser-project-representing-data-as-obs.html) 2018-11-16
 - [Miser Project: Representing Functions in ‹ob›’s Abstract World](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/12/miser-project-representing-functions-in.html) 2018-12-03,
 also dealing with interpretations of other structures in ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉,
 leaning toward computational interpretations.  This will be reflected under
 the [obreps](../obreps) topic.
 - [Miser Project: Interpretation, Representation, Computation, and Manifestation](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2019/02/miser-project-interpretation.html) 2019-02-11,
lengthy treatment of computational interpretation and a perspective on
the appreciation of computation applied to human affairs.  This will also be
repurposed to other topics of the Miser Project.

I invite discussion about Miser Project topics in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/issues).  There are also
relevant [projects](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/projects?type=classic)
from time to time.
