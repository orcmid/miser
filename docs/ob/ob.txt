NOTES AND TODO

 * My oldest preserved information on ‹ob› starts on the 2000-03-05 notebook
   #19.18-24 pages on the Miser Ob Level and ideas about quoted singletons
   where there were two different ideas about enclosures plus a kind of
   individual that linked to its "class" or something. The simplicity that I
   finally arrived at is not yet evident.

 * On pp. #19.26-27 I get to equality (distinction) of obs, and distinction
   of same-instance and is-equal.

 * By 2000-03-18 (#19.69-71) I am getting closer.  I am fumbling around with
   individuals versus "units," later to become singletons and individuals. I
   am getting close to the partial ordering, but speak of "is-later."

 * On 2000-04-19 (#20.35) I am using "≺" for what will become "¶"

 * On 2000-05-07 (#20.59) I am coming around to wanting a mathematical
   *structure* (rather than model) and also pondering about incidentals, what
   is alway more in an implementation.

 * I wanted to find the completeness paper about CONS, and also about
   assignment operations.  I also saw to introduce Peano Arithmetic in a
   constructive way, and about Boolean/propositional schemes too.

  * On 2000-05-20 (#20.74-76) I restate my thinking about abstraction,
   interpretation, and representation.  I get to individuals but am still
   thinking of quotations and not enclosures.  I get a littler stuck on
   the enumerability of individuals.  I'm not clear when that became a
   non-issue.

 * On 2001-01-11 (#27.38) I note a need to demonstrate countability and
   enumerability of Obs. This includes whether individuals are countable.
   I no longer have any doubt, since having the CFob canonical forms does
   the job. Even with synthetics, there is still CFob expression.

 * On 2001-05-24 (#30.10) I am still pondering the "≺" (and "≻") symbols and
   accepting that there is no such relation available to an implementation.
   The necessary precedence is accomplished by how an implementation works,
   but it is a partial ordering and it is satisfied by construction, but not
   available by inspection.  It is a nothing-burger.

 * On 2001-05-25 (#30.20) I get into the basic logical framework that is now
   stated under obtheory.txt sections on Logical Notation and Primitive
   Notions.  And I start using ¶ for the Precedence Condition.  I am doing
   this while at Logic, Language, and Computation (LLC) Workshop 10.

 * On 2001-05-26 (#30.25) I start demonstrating canonicalization of obs by
   simply writing a phrase-structure grammar for them, what will eventually
   become CFob.txt.  The key is to then claim that the obs are denumerable/
   countable, even though an enumeration might take some work. I'm still at
   LLC10.

 * On 2005-09-29 (#48.25) I was musing, regard to variables x, y, etc., that
   these are ways of having attention on particular Obs.  I'm not getting
   nutty about the platonism and the notion of all Obs somehow pre-existing.
   This musing also led to
   <https://miser-theory.info/notes/2002/06/n020600c.htm> though.  This now
   explains what earlier notes talking about as 0.05.  It is here, last
   updated on 2002-07-17
   <https://miser-theory.info/notes/2002/06/n020600.htm>.

 * On 2006-06-29 (#52.66) I am still musing about what I need for a pair
   operator.  I got to ":" but not "::" yet, for right-associative pairings.

 * On 2007-11-05 (#59.84) I signal the conception of ‹ob› as a structure
   tying all the pieces together.

 * On 2007-11-19 (#59.113, 116-120) I am struggling to develop Ot have the
   notion that "Ot is how we observe the structure.  Until we have Ot, we
   have not achieve the mathematical abstraction, because it is the Ot that
   gives the structure its existence as a mathemtical object."
      After that there is much stumbling around though.

 * On 2008-04-15 (#60.124) I'm looking at Miser, Frugal, and Logic versus
   computation.  I am now centered on the structure ‹ob› and the idea that
   Of has all of the functions f:Ob -> Ob.
