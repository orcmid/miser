                    GITHUB-PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                    -------------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/ folder provides the managed source-code for
    authoring GitHub Pages for the Miser Project Code web site.  The entire
    docs/ folder is automatically transformed by GitHub to produce the content
    of a web subdomain at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

TODO

  * Fill in about/ and construction/ index.htm pages.

  * Make this the home-page level and update index.md to form the front porch
    of this documentation hypertext.

  * Add license and NOTICE pages as was done with Hexo authoring.  In this
    case, they are part of the source and may as well be in Markdown (as well
    as plaintext?).

  * Prepare to bring miser-theory.info and especially the Miser Development
    blog pages into a folio structure here.  This will borrow "tutorial"
    materials and also have some application-development folder structure.

  * Eventually move the synopsis into a folio and have synopsis/index.md
    lead to it.

  * Determine whether and how much astraendo/ to transpose and preserve.
    Models and theory can be handled here, and the applied mathematical
    logic employed with the Miser Project

  * Determine whether and how much dev/ to preserve here.  This will tie-in
    the repository sections on oMiser and oFrugal for starters.

  * Likewise, determine what to do with notes/ and readings/, where the last
    might just be resources/ or maybe bib/, depending on breadth.

  * I will have to get some materials off of the VSS or directly in the IIS
    that I use for web-site development.

  * I can rescue HTML directly or I can use an authoring system, to be
    confirmed via orcmid/docEng and accomplish this indirectly.  It does
    mean that the authored form is held elsewhere and published to a working
    folder of this miser/docs material.  This current docs/ content can be
    reverse-engineered to the authoring place and published back to here when
    that becomes the approach.

  * There may be a serious change to folio structure and organization of
    topical pages (e.g., how index.md is used inside title folders) depending
    on the chosen framework.  I think this has to be figured out in docEng
    before I get too far in docs/ on orcmid.github.io documentation efforts.
