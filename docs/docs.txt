                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>

                    GITHUB-PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                    -------------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/ folder provides the managed source-code for
    authoring GitHub Pages.  The entire docs/ folder is automatically
    transformed by GitHub to produce the content of a web subdomain at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

TODO

  * Fill in about/ and construction/ index.htm pages.

  * Make this the home-page level and update index.md to form the front porch
    of this documentation hypertext.

  * Add license and NOTICE pages as was done with Hexo authoring.  In this
    case, they are part of the source and may as well be in Markdown (as well
    as plaintext?).
