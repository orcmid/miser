                           The Miser Project Code
                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>
             putlished at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>

                    GITHUB-PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                    -------------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/ folder provides the managed source-code for
    authoring GitHub Pages for the Miser Project Code web site.  The entire
    docs/ folder is automatically transformed by GitHub to produce the content
    of a web subdomain at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

    NOTE: GitHub Places is set to publish from this folder.  It is the case
          that Markdown files here will be converted to HTML, and there is
          support for Jekyll in those files (http://jekyllrb.com/).  However,
          files can be authored in separate locations and the HTML and other
          web-ready materials placed here.  GitHub will publish those "as is."
          This is relevant in the preservation of miser-theory.info content
          and the potential use of an alternative authoring scheme such as
          Hugo.

TODO

  * Fill in about/ and construction/ index.htm pages.

  * Make this the home-page level and update index.md to form the front porch
    of this documentation hypertext.

  * Fix index.md to be more accurate.  Also refer to the README.md for now.

  * Add license and NOTICE pages as was done with Hexo authoring.  In this
    case, they are part of the source and may as well be in Markdown (as well
    as plaintext?).

  * Prepare to bring miser-theory.info and especially the Miser Development
    blog pages into a folio structure here.  This will borrow "tutorial"
    materials and also have some application-development folder structure.

  * Eventually move the synopsis into a folio and have synopsis/index.md
    lead to it.

  * Determine whether and how much astraendo/ to transpose and preserve.
    Models and theory can be handled here, and the applied mathematical
    logic employed with the Miser Project

  * Determine whether and how much dev/ to preserve here.  This will tie-in
    the repository sections on oMiser and oFrugal for starters.

  * Likewise, determine what to do with notes/.

  * Document how forking/preservation of the miser-theory.info web pages
    are brought here and editable via FrontPage running in a VirtualBox.

  * I can rescue HTML directly or I can use an authoring system, to be
    confirmed via orcmid/docEng and accomplish this indirectly.  It does
    mean that the authored form is held elsewhere and published to a working
    folder of this miser/docs material.  This current docs/ content can be
    reverse-engineered to the authoring place and published back to here when
    that becomes the approach.

  * It is also possible to co-mingle between authored HTML and HTML staged
    from an authoring folder.  This can be managed as either a migration
    mechanism or simply a different way to make newer material.

  * There may be a serious change to folio structure and organization of
    topical pages (e.g., how index.md is used inside title folders) depending
    on the chosen framework.  I think this has to be figured out in docEng
    before I get too far in docs/ on orcmid.github.io documentation efforts.

  * Remake the home page in the style of nfoTools and D211101 and also relate
    how this is my career capstone project.  This is currently in the README
    and maybe it could be here also.

  * Use "run-time" instead of "engine" and characterize oMiser and oFrugal
    better.

  * I have confirmed that orcmid.github.io will recognize index.htm as the
    default page of a folder.  If there is also index.html, that will take
    precedence.  This means the nfoCentrale structures can be retained until
    no longer of interest, depending on how the site matures.

  * The preservation/forking of https://miser-theory.info material needs to
    be accounted for in the construction/ account here.

  * I can use FrontPage on my GitHub miser/docs folder after branching a
    shared folder in the MiserGitHub VSS.  The branch does not consist of
    shared material.  So I can continue to use FrontPage after .gitignore of
    the FrontPage artifacts.  This needs to be accounted for in the migration/
    preservation/forking process under docs/construction.

  * NOTE: Although GitHub/miser/docs is set as the VSS working folder for
    MiserGitHub, I have only done Get Latest on images/, readings/, and
    construction/ so far.  There is no collision with material that was
    already there. The extra folders that FrontPage creates are included in
    .gitignore to prevent check-in at GitHub.  Other pages have dependencies
    (relative, fortunately) on the construction materials so there needs to
    be preservation for now.
