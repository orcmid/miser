                           The Miser Project Code
                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>

                     GITHUB-AWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                     ---------------------------------

    This docs/ folder is setup as a GitHub aware location for management
    of GitHub Pages, possible Miser Project blog, and other documentation.
    A Wiki is also desirable but curation has not been established.

    This page is introduced to force recognition of the folder in Git
    and on GitHub.

TODO

  * Determine whether the docs.txt is recognized as a page or whether it
    can sit here intact and be used as a job jar.

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do nto seem to
    provide for that.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * GitHub Pages in docs/ is a bit like a wiki without the history and
    provision for other authors.  There is also no commenting mechanism.
    Having a blog here might work better.

  * I am grasping at straws here. There seems to be no satisfactory
    authoring mechanism for what I want in support of The Miser Project.

  * At <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-pro>
    it appears that Pages and Wikis are available on public GitHub Free
    accounts.  I need to make that clear.

   * The publishing mechanism is a little unclear.  It does seem that I
     require an index.md for home page.  It appears that .txt files should
     not be altered by the publishing mechanism.  This needs to be confirmed.

   * I am relying on <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>
     and trusting the material is current as of 2019-11-20.

   * I notice that the Wiki pages reflow properly but don't know the
     connection.  Check into <https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis>.

   * The Clone in Desktop does not seem to work on my computer.  The option
     does not come up.  I am uncertain how the Git process for working locally
     is intended to function.

   * Determine how I can have some kind of versioning on my .md pages and
     have that part be private (not rendered).  It depends on the GitHub
     Markdown and maybe some YAML control.  Must find out about that.

   * Try embedding HTML comments.

   * There seems to be a default theme if I don't pick one.  A nice feature
     of that is reflow works :).

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works on the default page.  This might be in a subfolder at some point.
