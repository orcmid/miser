                           The Miser Project Code
                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>
             putlished at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>

                    GITHUB-PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                    -------------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/ folder provides the managed source-code for
    authoring GitHub Pages for the Miser Project Code web site.  The entire
    docs/ folder is automatically transformed by GitHub to produce the content
    of a web subdomain at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

    WARNING:
          miser/docs/ is being refactored and repurposed to consolidate
          all Miser Project material, including that from miser-theory.info.
          Some other materials of the GitHub project are also consolidating
          under these GitHub Pages for affinity of definitive materials with
          the associated web documentation.  That proximity is to support
          consistent maintenance.

    NOTE: GitHub Pages is set to publish from this folder.  It is the case
          that Markdown files here will be converted to HTML, and there is
          support for Jekyll in those files (http://jekyllrb.com/).  However,
          files can be authored in separate locations and the HTML and other
          web-ready materials placed here.  GitHub will publish those "as is."
          This is relevant in the preservation of miser-theory.info content
          and the potential use of an alternative authoring scheme such as
          Hugo. It is also the case that FrontPage can be used for direct
          authoring of the HTML.

TODO

  * Fill in about/ and construction/ index.htm pages.  I am unsure that about/
    is necessary.

  * Remove readings/ when the repurposing and transposition at
    orcmid.github.io/bib/ is completed.  Then ditch the folder here.

  * Create more folio structure for the migration of the text folders to
    here.  I will need to place tombstones at the previous locations.

  * Add license and NOTICE pages as was done with Hexo authoring.  In this
    case, they are part of the source and may as well be in Markdown (as well
    as plaintext?).

  * Prepare to bring miser-theory.info and especially the Miser Development
    blog pages into a folio structure here.  This will borrow "tutorial"
    materials and also have some application-development folder structure.

  * Determine whether and how much astraendo/ to transpose and preserve.
    Models and theory can be handled here, and the applied mathematical
    logic employed with the Miser Project

  * Determine whether and how much dev/ to preserve here.  This will tie-in
    the repository sections on oMiser and oFrugal for starters.

  * Likewise, determine what to do with notes/.

  * Document how forking/preservation of the miser-theory.info web pages
    are brought here and editable via FrontPage running in a VirtualBox.
    This is going to be in docEng and not specific to miser.

  * I can rescue HTML directly or I can use an authoring system.  I have
    discovered that I can use Microsoft FrontPage to repurpose materials
    as part of transposition from nfoCentrale-housed projects to Orcmid on
    GitHub.  This is much more satisfying and I am going to reorganize the
    Miser Project docs/ to become the primary source, not unlike how nfoTools
    is working out.

  * If a framework is to be adopted at some future time, especially to be able
    to use LaTex formulas, we'll just have to see.  The mingled FrontPage may
    endure except where I do require a modern form.

  * The preservation/forking of https://miser-theory.info material needs to
    be accounted for in the construction/ account here.

  * I can use FrontPage on my GitHub miser/docs folder after branching a
    shared folder in the MiserGitHub VSS.  The branch does not consist of
    shared material.  So I can continue to use FrontPage after .gitignore of
    the FrontPage artifacts.  This needs to be accounted for in the migration/
    preservation/forking process under docs/construction.

  * NOTE: Although GitHub/miser/docs is set as the VSS working folder for
    MiserGitHub, I have only done Get Latest on images/, readings/, and
    construction/ so far.  There is no collision with material that was
    already there. The extra folders that FrontPage creates are included in
    .gitignore to prevent check-in at GitHub.  Other pages have dependencies
    (relative, fortunately) on the construction materials so there needs to
    be preservation for now.

  * Figure out what to do with the historical notebooks and information from
    those.
