                           The Miser Project Code
                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>
             putlished at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>

                    GITHUB-PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                    -------------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/ folder provides the managed web-page sources for
    the Miser Project on GitHub.  Publication is via GitHub Pages. The entire
    docs/ folder is automatically transformed to web pages published at the
     web subdomain <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

    WARNING:
          miser/docs/ is being refactored and repurposed to consolidate
          all Miser Project material, including that from miser-theory.info.
          Some other materials of the GitHub Miser repository  are refactored          under these GitHub Pages for affinity of original text materials under
          into this web documentation organization.  That proximity supports
          consistent maintenance.

    NOTE: GitHub Pages is set to publish from this folder.  It is the case
          that Markdown files here will be converted to HTML, and there is
          support for Jekyll in those files (http://jekyllrb.com/).  However,
          files can be authored in separate locations and the HTML and other
          web-ready materials placed here.  HTML files and assets can also be
          introduced here directly, as with FrontPage.  GitHub will publish
          those "as is. 
             There remains potential use of an alternative authoring scheme
          such as Hugo along with the use of LaTex formulas.

TODO

  * I am unsure that about/ is necessary.

  * Create more folio structure for the migration of the text folders to
    here.  I will need to place tombstones at the previous locations.

  * Add license and NOTICE pages as was done with Hexo authoring.  In this
    case, they are part of the source and may as well be in Markdown (as well
    as plaintext?).

  * Prepare to bring miser-theory.info and especially the Miser Development
    blog pages into a folio structure here.  This will borrow "tutorial"
    materials and also have some application-development folder structure.

  * Determine whether and how much astraendo/ to transpose and preserve.
    Models and theory can be handled here, and the applied mathematical
    logic employed with the Miser Project

  * Provide a dev/ folder here for the release of oMiser and oFrugal code.

  * Have ob for the theory structure.  There can be the subfolders as
    needed.  Or maybe there is theory and then components.  We could also

  * Likewise, determine what to do with notes/.

  * Document how forking/preservation of the miser-theory.info web pages
    are brought here and editable via FrontPage running in a VirtualBox.
    This is going to be in docEng and not specific to miser.

  * I can rescue HTML directly or I can use an authoring system.  I have
    discovered that I can use Microsoft FrontPage to repurpose materials
    as part of transposition from nfoCentrale-housed projects to Orcmid on
    GitHub.  This is much more satisfying and I am going to reorganize the
    Miser Project docs/ to become the primary source, not unlike how nfoTools
    is working out.

  * If a framework is to be adopted at some future time, especially to be able
    to use LaTex formulas, we'll just have to see.  The mingled FrontPage may
    endure except where I do require a modern form, such as some sort of
    JavaScript reliance.

  * I can use FrontPage on my GitHub miser/docs folder after branching a
    shared folder in the MiserGitHub VSS.  The branch does not consist of
    shared material.  So I can continue to use FrontPage after .gitignore of
    the FrontPage artifacts.  This needs to be accounted for in the migration/
    preservation/forking process under docs/construction.  [also DocEng]

  * NOTE: Although GitHub/miser/docs is set as the VSS working folder for
    MiserGitHub, I have only done Get Latest on images/, readings/, and
    construction/ so far.  There is no collision with material that was
    already there. The extra folders that FrontPage creates are included in
    .gitignore to prevent check-in at GitHub.  Other pages have dependencies
    (relative, fortunately) on the construction materials so there needs to
    be preservation for now. [also DocEng]

  * Figure out what to do with the historical notebooks and information from
    those.
