                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>

                     GITHUB-AWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                     ---------------------------------

    This docs/ folder is setup as a GitHub aware location for management
    of GitHub Pages, possible Miser Project blog, and other documentation.
    A Wiki is also desirable but curation has not been established.

    This page is introduced to force recognition of the folder in Git
    and on GitHub.

TODO

  * Determine whether the docs.txt is recognized as a page or whether it
    can sit here intact and be used as a job jar.

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do nto seem to
    provide for that.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * GitHub Pages in docs/ is a bit like a wiki without the history and
    provision for other authors.  There is also no commenting mechanism.
    Having a blog here might work better.

  * I am grasping at straws here. There seems to be no satisfactory
    authoring mechanism for what I want in support of The Miser Project.
