                       ------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/images/ folder provides the images for the GitHub
    Pages for Miser Project documentation.  It is part of the construction
    structure of the <https://orcmid.github.io/miser> web site.

    <https://miser-theory.info/images> is the origin of the material placed
    here on behalf of the preservation of the original Miser Project web site.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

TODO

  * The index.htm is recognized and preserved.  The index.md makes index.html
    and that will have priority when present.  Document this somewhere.

  * Figure out how to avoid getting crossed-up between the VSS and FrontPage
    and the GitHub and GitHub pages.  See if I can create a shared VSS
    repository and then break linkages for materials that I have transposed
    to GitHub.  A non-interference technique if it works.

  * Tombstone the construction.htm "Construction History" page here.  It was
    long ago supplanted by a refined construction structure.  That may be
    no longer needed.

  * Much of this should be somewhere generic such as docEng.  For now, we do
    what we need to concerning preservation/forking of miser-theory.info.

  * Fix the image employed in construction.htm.  This may need FrontPage to
    get the Include Pages working.

  * Fix the logos one more time, this time adding the a and b labels in the
    top pair.  This can then be explained a little on the home page.

  * The GIF logos should be scaled to 210 x 134 or close enough, and also with
    transparency.  I am assuming that Visio downscaling from vectors will work
    better than FrontPage down-sampling.  We will see.
