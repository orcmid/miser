                       ------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/images/ folder provides the images for the GitHub
    Pages for Miser Project documentation.  It is part of the construction
    structure of the <https://orcmid.github.io/miser> web site.

    <https://miser-theory.info/images> is the origin of the material placed
    here on behalf of the preservation of the original Miser Project web site.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the construction/ page and
    its subordinate material.

TODO

  * The index.htm is recognized as the default page, which is nifty.  I need
    to adjust its links to locations and images here though.  The preservation
    of construction structure is useful.

  * Adjust to life on GitHub pages. See whether index.html takes precedence
    over index.htm or not.

  * Preserve but obsolete the Construction History page here.

  * Figure out how to avoid getting crossed-up between the VSS and FrontPage
    and the GitHub and GitHub pages.  See if I can create a shared VSS
    repository and then break linkages for materials that I have transposed
    to GitHub.  A non-interference technique if it works.

  * Tombstone the construction.htm page here.  It was long ago supplanted
    by a refined construction structure.

  * Replace the [o]misertheory*.gif files with versions of the plain ob
    diagram without any other words.

  * Upgrade the front-porch n170601d2 VSDX and PNG images

  * Much of this should be somewhere generic such as docEng.  For now, we do
    what we need to concerning preservation/forking of miser-theory.info.
