<h1>Obsolete Material</h1>
<dl></dt><b>2024-01-05T22:05Z Page Preserved but Tombstoned</b></dt>
<dd>The construction scaffolding and the interconnection of construction zones has 
    changed considerably since this images folder was created on <b>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">miser-theory.info</font></b>. This page is 
preserved although detached from the network of Construction Zones.&nbsp; Note 
that the logo image being described is no longer used on this page and the 
associated issues have been resolved.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Change History</h1>

<dl>
  <dt><b>2002-07-12-19:35 Update Project Logo (<a href="../construction/orcmid.htm">orcmid</a>)</b></dt>
  <dd>1. The &quot;grey&quot; cloud didn't come out solid, and my first efforts
    to make it solid in Visio always ended up with a blue-tinted cloud (a
    coherence issue to look at).<br>
    2. I accomplished what I needed by pasting the image from Visio 5.0 into
    Microsoft Image Composer and creating the GIF version from there.&nbsp;
    (Because I want transparency, I can't use the PNG version anyhow and I have
    removed it.)<br>
    3. There are two copies of the image.&nbsp; The one named <b><code>MiserTheory-logo.gif
    </code></b>is the current overall logo, reflecting the state of Miser
    Project development and the focus of attention.&nbsp; The copy named <b><code>oMiserTheory-logo.gif</code></b>
    will always be applicable to the materials on oMiser (including oFrugal,
    though oFrugal may receive its own logo later on).<br>
    4. The images are of slightly different size than the ones being
    replaced.&nbsp; Consequently, as I revisit pages that use these logos I need
    to reset the picture properties appearance settings to use the new size
    rather than cause the image to be scaled to the old size.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><b>2002-07-11-15:13 Introduce First Miser Project Logo (<a href="../construction/orcmid.htm">orcmid</a>)</b></dt>
  <dd>A variation of the oMiser Sketch image is transformed into an
    oMiserTheory-logo.&nbsp; This logo is used as the prevailing logo until
    there is progression to a new level.&nbsp; The oMiser level will remain
    where the focus is on oMiser, though.&nbsp; I anticipate having oFrugal and
    similar logos.&nbsp; These can also show up on splash pages and so on.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><strong>2002-02-24-07:12 Create Initial <b><i>Miser Project</i><code> /images</code></b> mini-Web (orcmid)</strong></dt>
  <dd>1. To provide for separate mirroring of <b><i>The Miser Project</i></b>
    subweb, an independent <b><code>/images</code></b> subdirectory is created
    and used.<br>
    2. I don't have a Miser Project logo, so I borrowed the Orcmid's Lair logo
    and renamed it until I can substitute a new image.</dd>
