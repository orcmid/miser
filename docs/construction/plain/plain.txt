                    CONFIRMED PLAIN TEMPLATE EXPERIENCE
                    -----------------------------------

    Page <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/about/construction/current/> shows
    the rendering of Markdown features using the current theme.  When that
    theme changes in any manner, current/ and all other pages will be
    automatically adjusted.

    This page provides confirmation, via text and screen captures, of the
    experience when no action is taken to specify a Google Pages template.
    This is taken to be the plain template.  This creates a comparison with
    how the same features are (or are not) handled with a different template.

    It is not known what the stability of the plain template happens to be.
    The presentation at this folder is based on behavior observed on 2019-
    11-20 and continuing until further notice.

    Although the page authored here provides confirmation of experience with
    the (2019-11-20) plain template, any change of that default GitHub Pages
    template used will also impact the rendering of plain/index.md into HTML.
    It will not impact the narrative and the images captured before a change.

    There are some hyperlinks from plain/ to sections of current/.  To the
    degree that the same document headings and the generation of their perma-
    links are preserved, these links provide a kind of blink-comparison
    between the results with the plain template and any other template's
    rendering of the current/ page.

               "plain" default without explicit setting of any template.

 TODO

  * Capture the title under linking and the treatment of heading anchors.

  * Capture the footer and account for how not-useful it is.

  * Capture the permalink and account for it (as in current/ as well).

  * Explain about confirmable experience enough.  It would be nice to treat
    this somewhere where it can be described generally.

  * Tie to the construction approach and correspond with the construction
    structure of web sites such as <http://miser-theory.info>.

  * Capture the automatic page top and page bottom that occur with plain.
