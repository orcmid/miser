		<p>THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 
		CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;).&nbsp; THE WORK IS 
		PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; ANY USE OF THE 
		WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS 
		PROHIBITED. </p>
		<p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND 
		AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.&nbsp; THE LICENSOR 
		GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE 
		OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. </p>
		<p><strong>1. Definitions</strong> </p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>&quot;Collective Work&quot;</strong> 
			means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, 
			in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a 
			number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent 
			works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work 
			that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a 
			Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>&quot;Derivative Work&quot;</strong> 
			means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other 
			pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, 
			dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound 
			recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other 
			form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, 
			except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be 
			considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For 
			the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or 
			sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation 
			with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered a Derivative 
			Work for the purpose of this License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>&quot;Licensor&quot;</strong> means 
			the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of 
			this License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>&quot;Original Author&quot;</strong> 
			means the individual or entity who created the Work.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>&quot;Work&quot;</strong> means the 
			copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this 
			License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>&quot;You&quot;</strong> means an 
			individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has 
			not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to 
			the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor 
			to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>2. Fair Use Rights.</strong> Nothing in this license is 
		intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, 
		first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright 
		owner under copyright law or other applicable laws. </p>
		<p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms and 
		conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, 
		royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the 
		applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as 
		stated below: </p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">to reproduce the Work, to 
			incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to 
			reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">to create and reproduce Derivative 
			Works;   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">to distribute copies or phonorecords 
			of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by 
			means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as 
			incorporated in Collective Works;   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">to distribute copies or phonorecords 
			of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by 
			means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">For the avoidance of doubt, where 
			the work is a musical composition:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ol type="i">
				<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>Performance Royalties 
				Under Blanket Licenses</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive 
				right to collect, whether individually or via a performance 
				rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the 
				public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) 
				of the Work.   
				</li>
				<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>Mechanical Rights and 
				Statutory Royalties</strong>. Licensor waives the exclusive 
				right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights 
				agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties 
				for any phonorecord You create from the Work (&quot;cover version&quot;) 
				and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 
				USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in 
				other jurisdictions).</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px"><strong>Webcasting Rights and 
			Statutory Royalties</strong>. For the avoidance of doubt, where the 
			Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to 
			collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society 
			(e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance 
			(e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license 
			created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the 
			equivalent in other jurisdictions). 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether 
		now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to 
		make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the 
		rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by 
		Licensor are hereby reserved.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Restrictions.&nbsp; </strong>The license granted in 
		Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the 
		following restrictions: </p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">You may distribute, publicly 
			display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work 
			only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy 
			of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every 
			copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, 
			publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer 
			or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of 
			this License or the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted 
			hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all 
			notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of 
			warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly 
			perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any 
			technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a 
			manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The 
			above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but 
			this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself 
			to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a 
			Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
			extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as 
			required by clause 4(b), as requested.&nbsp; If You create a 
			Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
			extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as 
			required by clause 4(b), as requested.</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">If you distribute, publicly display, 
			publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any 
			Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all 
			copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium 
			or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or 
			pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original 
			Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a 
			sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in 
			Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable 
			means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if 
			supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource 
			Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with 
			the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or 
			licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative 
			Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative 
			Work (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or 
			&quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). Such credit 
			may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that 
			in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum 
			such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit 
			appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other 
			comparable authorship credit. </li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</strong></p>
		<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, 
		LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR 
		WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY 
		OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, 
		MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR 
		THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF 
		ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
		NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT 
		APPLY TO YOU.</p>
		<p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT 
		REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU 
		ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE 
		OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, 
		EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
		</p>
		<p><strong>7. Termination</strong> </p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">This License and the rights granted 
			hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the 
			terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received 
			Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, 
			however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such 
			individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those 
			licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination 
			of this License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">Subject to the above terms and 
			conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration 
			of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, 
			Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different 
			license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; 
			provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw 
			this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to 
			be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will 
			continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong> </p>
		<ol type="a">
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">Each time You distribute or publicly 
			digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers 
			to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and 
			conditions as the license granted to You under this License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">Each time You distribute or publicly 
			digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the 
			recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and 
			conditions as the license granted to You under this License.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">If any provision of this License is 
			invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect 
			the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this 
			License, and without further action by the parties to this 
			agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent 
			necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">No term or provision of this License 
			shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver 
			or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged 
			with such waiver or consent.   
			</li>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 12px">This License constitutes the entire 
			agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed 
			here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations 
			with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be 
			bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
			communication from You. This License may not be modified without the 
			mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. <br>
