                     MARKDOWN FEATURE CONFIRMATION PAGE
                     ----------------------------------

    Page <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/construction/current/> shows
    the rendering of Markdown features using the current theme.  The page
    content is based on theme demonstrations provided by GitHub and also the
    feature tests adapted from Hexo blog authoring/generation template tests.

    Additional features for examination and demonstration/confirmation have
    been obtained by digital forensics of generated pages.

    This folder provides the authoring for that page used to confirm the
    experience of features from one template to the next.  The first, default
    theme is accounted for in the companion page at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/construction/plain/>.

 TODO

  * Use the available theme demonstrations with code blocks revealing how
    each is produced.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2019-11-20:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

  * Provide default rendering with no explicit template as the first case.

  * Explain that examining the source via GitHub will show a formatted
    version and the Raw view must be chosen to see the actual "source."

  * Introduce the comment markers at this level.  Not clear if provenance
    of template matters.  If so, it should apply here.

  * See what can be made of view source also.  Also the developer view.  This
    is a little document forensics.

  * The headers automatically get anchors it appears, so we can do
    permalinks.  They also show up with link symbols on a heading mouse-over.
    We want to be able to use these when cross-referencing within a page.  We
    want this to be available on any themes we use.  Demonstrate along with
    headers or immediately afterwards.

  * The page-top title identifies the mini-web and links to its "root."

  * Use "mini-web" to avoid confusion with sub-domain?

  * The difference with rendering in publishing a mini-web, versus rendering
    of markdown in-place in a repository view is simply the source location?
    This should be verifiable with cross-references and local linking.

  * demonstrate image squeezing along with text-flow adjustment.  This will
    have to be captured under plain also.
