<!-- This page is used by FrontPage "Include Page" components on ordinary pages of this web site.
     There is nothing in the body but what we want included.  For the present page,
     the body contains text to be placed in the center cell of the Construction Block on the page
     bottom.  This text will then appear exactly the way we want.  Editing of the text is not
     done in the pages that include the component.  Instead, the image is edited on this page
     and the changes will be automatically propogated to all other pages that include this page.
