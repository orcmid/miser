              GITHUB MISER PROJECT DOCS CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL
              -----------------------------------------------

    This material is forked and transposed from the construction structure
    approach employed on miser-theory.info.  Check-out of the forked branch
    has not conflicted with materials and techniques already here.

    This methodology is adapted for here without much explanation.  That
    document engineering practice, applied to a web site, will be detailed
    in some common place applicable to more of orcmid.github.io.

 TODO

   * Find a clean way to talk about the *authored" documentation and the
    *authoring" source that is published to be the documentation.  Need some
    nomenclature that I don't keep tripping over.

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do not seem to
    provide for that.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2019-11-20:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

  * The default rendering, with no template, provides reflow in the manner
    required for Miser Project documentation.  How to ensure that with any
    of the provided themes remains to be understood.

   * I have been employing in-line HTML comments to account for versioning
     of markdown pages here.  I don't know if there is something better, using
     YAML or something.

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works with the default template.  Use construction/test/ or example/
     for that.

   * Create a test document (set) that demonstrates the main Markup
     provisions.

   * Create a folder (i.e., plain/ that carries captured images of the
     current test/demo document under the default template)

   * Create a version of the text ruler for the markdown pages.

   * Make a template for the index.md source pages.

   * Add a forensics folder on web-site and authoring, plus trouble-shooting,
     reverse-engineering, etc.  Maybe this belongs on docEng.

   * Confirm preservation with pre-HTML5 browsers, such as Internet Explorer.

   * The "improve this page" and edit/master link requires being logged-in to
     GitHub.  We need a way to suppress that.  Document this in "plain."

  * The folio system is a bit different here.  There can be a counterpart in
    how pages and their assets are in folders.  The idea of version sequences
    does not quite work unless we take it to a lower level.  The use of insert
    pages might have no counterpart here.  Having the effect would take
    copying.

  * GitHub, and use of Git, provides a valuable history and provenance system.
    It requires access to such "document forensic" tools and doesn't support
    removed (? what phrase did I intend here) prints of pages the way I have
    desired.  I think this is about wanting to always have material be
    printable and having its provenance/origin be explicit in it.

  * Repair the substructure and content of construction/ to reside directly at
    docs/construction/ and https://orcmid.github.io/miser/construction.

  * Use the c071101/ Repaving folio to extend to tracking and accounting for
    the transposition of miser-theory.info materials and perhaps others to
    orcmid.github.io/miser.

  * That I can use FrontPage, even at this point, to edit HTML here, is wild.
    I may need to continue that.  I will also need to provide an account of
    frameworks and different models (sort of perpetually reinvented in new
    clothes) on docEng.

  * Find a better place to have "What's an Orcmid" and have that resolved
    for the preservation activity.  I must get that done first.  It is going
    to apply to all preservation materials.
