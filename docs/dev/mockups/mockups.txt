                OMISER MOCKUP EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATIONS
                -----------------------------------------

    oMiser mockups are proof-of-concept demonstrations using available
    programming-language arrangements.

    There is sufficient companion documentation with the mockups so that
    others can operate them, confirm the test cases, and observe how the
    abstract computational interpretation can be manifest using available
    computational mechanisms with desktop PCs.  Empirical validation and
    verification is demonstrated thereby.  The difference between the formal
    definitions of the ‹ob› computational model and the programming and
    testing of implementations is demonstrated in this manner.

    The mockups are not production level.  They need only be simple enough
    and sufficient for demonstration of oMiser and oFrugal representations.
    A different framework will be employed for spiral development of stable,
    production releases with more-appealing stability, performance, and
    interchange of developed computational-model scripts.

    The first mockups are written in Standard ML and processed using Standard
    ML of New Jersey.  Down the road, the affinity with SML/NJ and its roots
    in Logic for Computable Functions will be examined more closely.

TODO

  * Document the SML mockups sufficient for others to replicate and also
    contribute to the work.

  * Choose among F#, Java, Python, JavaScript and Clean C COM demonstrations
    for further confirmations of the ‹ob› computational model at the oMiser level.
