                           ======================

       <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/docs.txt>

                    GITHUB-PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION FOLDER
                    -------------------------------------

    The Miser Project docs/ folder provides the managed source-code for
    authoring GitHub Pages.  The entire docs/ folder is automatically
    transformed by GitHub to produce the content of a web subdomain at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>.

    Further information about the purpose, construction, and care-and-feeding
    of this web authoring arrangement are found on the about/ page and its
    subordinate construction/ material.
