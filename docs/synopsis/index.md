The Miser Project is a practical exploration of key concepts at the foundation
of computer science.

Project elements demonstrate the fundamental nature and simplicity of
computation.  From that simple foundation, operational implementations of
computer programs are created, at first using a simple processing language
(**Frugal**), that demonstrate the clear possibility of elegant, consistent computational systems of great power based on elementary but rigorous
foundations.

The project begins by formulating and then constructing a simple, well-defined
and easily-analyzed family of computational mechanisms, the **Miser Engines**.
The progression of Miser engines makes clear where gains in power are
available and where the limitations of computation are inescapable.
A key objective is investigation of computational regimes that interact
in/with worlds "outside/beyond" themselves.

The basic data elements of Miser are different from the structures used in
conventional programming systems.  These elements, the
[**Miser Obs**](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/obtheory.txt), are similar to those of Lisp and other list-processing languages, although
Miser is not Lisp.

This choice of initial elements supports seven project themes:
