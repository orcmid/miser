                     MARKDOWN FEATURE CONFIRMATION PAGE
                     ----------------------------------

    Page <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/about/construction/current/> shows
    the rendering of Markdown features using the current theme.  The page
    is based on the theme demonstrations provided by GitHub and also the
    feature tests I adapted when using Hexo as a blog authoring/generation
    mechanism.

    This folder provides the authoring for that page.

 TODO

  * Use the available theme demonstrations with code blocks revealing how
    each is produced.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2019-11-20:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

  * Provide default rendering with no explicit template as the first case.

       page template.
