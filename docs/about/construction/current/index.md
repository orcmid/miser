This page demonstrates the layout and Markdown effects supported by the
current (default), template's rendering of <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>

## TEXT TREATMENT

### Paragraph Flow

The flow of paragraph text from line-to-line and spacing
from one paragraph to the next is presented in this and
the next paragraph.

There should be one blank line between these two paragraphs.
If the browser view is widened or narrowed, the text flow
should change to keep all of the text in view.

The above text and the titles were produced with the following Markdown text.
