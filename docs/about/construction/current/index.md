# MISER PROJECT DOCS: CURRENT MARKDOWN TREATMENT

This page demonstrates the layout and Markdown effects supported by the
current (default), template's rendering of <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>
pages.  This page is rendered at
<https://orcmid.github.io/miser/about/construction/current/>.  It is authored
at
<https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/about/construction/current/index.md>.

## TEXT TREATMENT

### Paragraph Flow

The flow of paragraph text from line-to-line and spacing
from one paragraph to the next is presented in this and
the next paragraph.

There should be one blank line between these two paragraphs.
If the browser view is widened or narrowed, the text flow
should change to keep all of the text in view.

The above text and the titles were produced with the following Markdown text.
```text

### Special Text Features

A special text formatting is `code-style` or `typewriter`.

Characters used for special markdown purposes can be **escaped** with "\\"
to simply appear as text characters:

   \\ \` \* \_ \# \+ \- \. \! \( \[ \{ \} \] \)

For Markdown pages in the repository (but not GitHub pages) emoji are defined
at the [emoji cheat sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/),
including :smile: :boom: :heart: :kiss: :floppy_disk: :mouse:

The largests header is generally used for the overall title.

### H3 Header
