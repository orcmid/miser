 TODO

  * Determine whether the docs.txt is recognized as a page or whether it
    can sit here intact and be used as a job jar.

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do not seem to
    provide for that.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * The publishing mechanism is a little unclear.  It does seem that I
    require an index.md for home page.  It appears that .txt files should
    not be altered by the publishing mechanism.  This needs to be confirmed.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2019-11-20:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

  * The default rendering, with no template, provides reflow in the manner
    required for Miser Project documentation.  How to ensure that with any
    of the provided themes remains to be understood.

   * Determine how I can have some kind of versioning on my .md pages and
     have that part be private (not rendered).  It depends on the GitHub
     Markdown and maybe some YAML control.  Must find out about that.

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works with the default template.  Use construction/test/ or example/
     for that.
