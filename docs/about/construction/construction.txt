 TODO

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do not seem to
    provide for that.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2019-11-20:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

  * The default rendering, with no template, provides reflow in the manner
    required for Miser Project documentation.  How to ensure that with any
    of the provided themes remains to be understood.

   * Determine how I can have some kind of versioning on my .md pages and
     have that part be private (not rendered).  It depends on the GitHub
     Markdown and maybe some YAML control.  Must find out about that.

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works with the default template.  Use construction/test/ or example/
     for that.

   * Create a test document (set) that demonstrates the main Markup
     provisions.

   * Create a folder (i.e., plain/ that carries captured images of the
     current test/demo document under the default template)
