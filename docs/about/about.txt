                           The Miser Project Code
                           ======================

     <https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/docs/about/about.txt>

                  ABOUT THE GITHUB-HOSTED DOCUMENTATION
                  -------------------------------------

    The about/ page and its subordinates address the documentation
    hypertext and not the Miser Project itself.

    Other portions of <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/> introduce subject-
    matter of the project, including tie-in to the code under GitHub.

 TODO

  * Find a clean way to talk about the *authored" documentation and the
    *authoring" source that is published to be the documentation.  Need some
    nomenclature that I don't keep tripping over.

  * Emphasize that the about page addresses the documentation web site
    and not the overall project.  It might link to the project on GitHub.
    It might link to other collateral sources as well.

  * The construction subsection documents the authoring arrangement and
    also provides confirmation checks, any template modification, etc.

  * Identify adaptation of the infrastructure technique used on sites such
    as miser-theory or the nfoCentrale sites in general.  Find appropriate
    links.
