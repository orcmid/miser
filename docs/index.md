# The Miser Project on GitHub

> [**Computation Theory Made Operational**](https://github.com/orcmid/miser#readme)

This under-construction web site will become the home of Miser Project
documentation on GitHub.

For now, most materials are in text files spread around the repository at
[GitHub orcmid/miser](https://github.com/orcmid/miser).  The organization is
narrated in files with the same name as a folder, such as
[miser.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/miser.txt) and
[oMiser.txt](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/blob/master/oMiser/oMiser.txt).

Placeholder initiated 2019-11-20T08:37

Construction structure at [docs.txt](docs.txt) for now.
