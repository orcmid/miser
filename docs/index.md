## Refactoring/Preservation Underway

This under-development web site will become the home for Miser Project
documentation, using GitHub Pages and publication to
[orcmid.github.io/miser](.).

There is also the prospect of using a
[Miser Project Github Wiki](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/wiki),
although there are some inconveniences to be conquered.

Meanwhile, there is some information at
[Miser Theory](https://miser-theory.info) until useful/historical content is
transposed to this GitHub site.

Descriptive information of the foundation conception is also available in
blog articles commencing with
[Hark! Is That a Theory I see Before Me?](https://orcmid.blogspot.com/2018/07/miser-project-hark-is-that-theory-i-see.html).

The current introduction to the overall project is at the
[Miser Project README](https://github.com/orcmid/miser#readme).  That is the
best statement at this time.

## Current Technical Materials

The recording of Miser Project efforts has been captured in an organization
of folders containing text files, images, and some prototype code.  The set
of folders is all under the
[Orcmid Miser repository](https://github.com/orcmid/miser) on GitHub.  Each
folder has a text file of the same name (e.g., `miser.txt`).  These provide
some technical information and also a manifest for their content, including
subfolders (each having their own-named `.txt` files). For now, most materials
are in text files spread around the repository in this manner.

The most-current and fleshed-out materials are in the folder
[oMiser](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/tree/master/oMiser).

Initial setup of the Miser Project on GitHub was with text-only materials in
this relatively-informal organization and stitching of folders.  The prospect
of a GitHub Pages web site as part of the repository was not anticipated.
Undertaking that, now, will involve some refactoring to avoid conflicting
authoritative materials.  The current materials remain usable for now; when
any are supplanted, appropriate tombstones and cross-references will be
established.

I invite discussion about Miser Project topics in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/issues).  There are also
relevant [projects](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/projects?type=classic)
from time to time.
