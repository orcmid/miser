# The Miser Project

This space is under construction.

It is an experimental employment of GitHub Pages at `master/docs/` to see
whether the documentation and blogging needs of the project can be met here
with minimal fuss.

The published form of the pages is at (<https://orcmid.github.io/miser/)>

Local references to content are in the manner of [docs.txt](docs.txt),
perhaps.

The footer, offering page improvement (and presumably requiring a push
request) is maybe not what I had in mind.

An important feature of the default (i.e., none-specified) theme is that
reflow on change of browser view width is automatic and as desired.

I do have some concerns about explicit versioning and having content that
is skipped.  I can specify HTML comments?

<!-- This is an HTML comment -->

We will run through all of the Markdown options to see how they are
rendered here.  Theme demos provide a nice comparison.

Demonstration of the current theme can be found at [demo.txt](demo.txt)
here.
