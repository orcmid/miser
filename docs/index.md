# The Miser Project

This space is under construction.  This page will become the home page for
The Miser Project documentation on GitHub.

It is an experimental employment of GitHub Pages at `master/docs/` to see
whether the documentation and blogging needs of the project can be met here
with minimal fuss.

The published form of the pages is at <https://orcmid.github.io/miser/>

Notes on the plumbing within the structure are found at pages such as
[docs.txt](docs.txt).  Such markdown pages are moved intact to the published
form.

The footer, offering page improvement (and presumably requiring a push
request) is maybe not what I had in mind.

An important feature of the default (i.e., none-specified) theme is that
reflow on change of browser view width is automatic and as desired.

I do have some concerns about explicit versioning and having content that
is skipped.  I can specify HTML comments though.

<!-- This is an HTML comment -->

We will run through all of the Markdown options to see how they are
rendered here.  Theme demos provide a nice comparison.

Demonstration of the current theme, including the markdown elements, is
at [current](about/construction/current/) here.
