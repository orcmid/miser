## Initial Placeholder

An important capability of ‹ob› = 〈Ob,Of,Ot〉is the ability to identify
interpretations of other mathematical structures in ‹ob›.  There are three
informative cases for starters.

First, the interpretation of Boolean algebras establishes a wide case of
applicability from one mathematical structure to another via a simulation
representation.  The "=" in Boolean algebras does not carry over to "=" in
‹ob› but representation is assured by isomorphism of canonical forms.  This
is an important situation for obtaining computational interpretations of
structures via computational interpretation of ‹ob›.

Secondly, the interpretation of Combinators via ‹ob› relies on the
correspondence of the obap.ap function with the apply operation of structure
‹ca› (and hence of the λ-calculus also).  There is no "=" for ‹ca› and no
prospect of a canonical form for the interpretation in ‹ob›.  This points at
theoretical limitations of computation and of powerful mathematical theories.

Connection of ‹ob› with number theory is via the Z2adic interpretations, among
many alternative approaches.  This is important with regard to demonstration
of Church-Turing completeness by expression of number theoretical functions
and their computation.  This is the neighborhood of mathematics around which
the Church-Turing hypothesis arose.  Z2adic is demonstration that oMiser
attains the Church-Turing level, as well as providing an usable arithmetic.

There will be additional interpretations that further this appreciation,
including a Turing Machines simulation.
