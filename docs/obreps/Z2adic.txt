                Z 2'S COMPLEMENT ARITHMETIC IMPLEMENTATION
                ------------------------------------------

        The interpretation of Integer Arithmetic is based on the ‹ba›
        simulation of Boolean Algebra using ob.bvx for arbitrary length
        Boolean vectors.  See boole.txt for details.

        For Z2adic, ob.bvx structures are interpreted as 2's complement binary
        numerals.  The terminal element, followed by a ":" is taken as the
        sign.  It is called a bumper and it stands for an indefinite sequence
        of the same digit.  The numerals are taken to have
        taken as being an extension of that bit indefinitely.  The notation
        is little-endian.  The first element is the lowest-order bit of the
        numeral.

        The name is a combination of Z (the negative and non-negative integer
        domain) and 2-adic with respect to the form of numerals and their
        connection to the more general 2-adic numerals.


     1. SYNOPSIS: THE FUNDAMENTAL REPRESENTATION

        For the arithmetic interpretation, write 0 and 1 instead of the
        corresponding bot, ⊥, and top, ⊤.  1:0 represents 1, 01:0
        represents 2,  11:0 represents 3, and 001:0 represents 4.  Notice
        that the left-to-right reading of the bits is from low-order bit to
        successively higher ones.

        The form :0 is a "bumper."  It signifies an inexhaustible sequence of
        0 digits (bits).  It is a shorthand for as many 0 digits as are
        useful. The unique canonical form of a :0-terminated sequence is
        achieved by removing every 0 the left of the :0 bumper up until any
        1 bit.  So :0 is the canonical form for representing integer 0.

        The form :1 is the bumper for an inexhaustible sequence of 1 bits.
        The canonical form of of a :1-terminated sequence is achieved by
        removing ever 1 to the left of the :1 bumper up until any 0.  So
        :1 for 111...:1 with any number of 1's forming 111... .  Numerically,
        it is the form for representing -1.

        The binary numerals are taken as 2's-complement binary numerals
        in which :1 represents integer -1, 0:1 represents -2, 10:1 for -3,
        and so on.

        In this scheme the negation of a number is expressed by adding 1 (an
        incoming carry) to the 1's-complement of the Z2adic expression of the
        given number.  Ths can be done in a single left-to-right scan of the
        original numeral, replacing digits as follows.

         1. a. If there is a carry in, a 0 remains 0 and there's a carry out.
            b. If there is no carry in, a 0 becomes 1 with no carry out.

         2. a. If there is a carry in, a 1 remains 1 with no carry out.
            b. If there is no carry in, a 1 becomes a 0 with no carry out.

         3. a. If there is a carry in, :0 remains :0 and we're done.
            b. If there is no carry in, :0 becomes :1 and we're done.

         4  a. If there is a carry in, :1 becomes the pair 1:0 and we're done.
            b. If there is no carry in, :1 becomes :0 and we're done.

        In this scheme, the 2's complement of :0 is :0 as expected.  And
        the 2's complement of :1 is 1:0 as expected.

        [EDITOR'S NOTE: THE RULE 3a DEPENDS ON A KIND OF JUST-SHORT-OF-
         INFINITARY ARGUMENT.  THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH SOMEWHERE BELOW.]

 2. MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE

    The mathematical structure ‹Z› is introduced in the same manner as for
    ‹ob› and <ba>.  We start with the structure ‹N› of Peano Numbers, and then
    expand that to achieve structure ‹Z› of all integers.

    ‹N› = 〈Ni,Nf,Nt〉
    ‹Z› = 〈Zi,Zf,Zt〉


5. NOTES AND REFERENCES

    **** DECIDE WHAT MATTERS HERE AND REFERENCE boole.txt as needed.

    Symbols for Boolean operations are kept distinct from the logical
    connectives used in FOL= notation, hence the use of complement,
    meet, join, sep symbols and fussiness in qualifying names of function
    representations by the name of the particular structure and interpreta-
    tion, if any.

    These notational devices facilitate recognition of correspondences
    without implying identity, avoiding for a time any tacit collapsing of
    separate notions together as if about the same theoretical entities.

 NOTES AND TODOS:

  * Complete the refactoring and establish tombstones in the previous
    location.  There are incorrect cross-references in this material.

  * It is terrible to have so much material lying around from boole.txt still.
    I need to clean this up and also complete the refactoring to obreps/.

  * I don't need to deal with rationals yet.  I think that will be Q2adic
    and I suspect that the recurring bits will be tricky.  The Z2adic part
    should be the same.  There is a difficulty on how to work to the "right"
    of the binary point and how that gets reconciled.  The problem seems to
    be with addition.

  * When representation, interpretation, manifestation, implementation,
    and simulation are worked out more clearly, review these materials
    for consistent usage and links to related resources of the project and
    and elsewhere, especially ones of reference/historical value.

  * Find a nice algebraic characterization of Z, maybe even from Peano, and
    give the attribution and and further considerations.  We are on the edge
    of recursive function theory here.

  * Replace rulers with the preferred form now used that also allows digital-
    signature armor.

  * Replace the references to wordpress pages to the Blogger pages but then
    to orcmid.github.io/miser pages.

  * There is something wrong with the [Knuth1998] Exercise 4.1(31).  Having
    1/7 and -1/7 be exactly represented in 2-adic numerals doesn't compute
    and there is no binary point in the examples.  Track this down.
    See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number> for related references
    and explanations.  Also, Wikipedia refers to an older K. Hensel paper.

  * I am trying to square dyadic rational, in this case binary rational
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational> with this.

  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number> provides a similar case to
    what Knuth provides.  I still don't understand how the rationals fall out
    and I am only using the Z integers representation.  There is still some
    missing trick here.  I think it has to do with repetitions but the tie-in
    with many Higher Algebra cases obscures all of this for me.

  * I have chosen Zadic for the name here.  I need to be able to back that up
    or switch to an arithmetic, although Nadic, Zadic, and Qadic are fun.

  * I am satisfied with the rules given in the synopsis/sketch.  I do need to
    distinguish the (prime) radix that's understood.  So, should it be Z2adic
    or Zadic2.  I think it should be first.  Then Q2adic follows.  Also, there
    can be an N1adic as well as an N2adic, the first being the counting with
    sticks (or successors of 0).

  * I posted a demonstration of the inexhaustible bumpers and the carry rule
    in the Z2adic case to FOM.  We'll see how that lands.  I am restating it
    here, now.

 * Representing Rationales: (2025-11-18) I was having a conversation in my
   head about explaining why ‹ob› Obs are acyclic and what can one do when
   wanting to represent a cyclic number.  There is a device in [Knuth1998:
   Exercise 4.1(31)] that I have not mastered, but there is a way to do a
   kind of generator "for as many elements as you want, but always finite."
   There has to be some constraint to avoid looping indefinitely, of course.
   Consider a pair [next, rep:] where, if next is a singleton, we proceed
   with [.a rep, rep:] and otherwise take .a next as the next item and the
   continuation is [.b next, rep:]  That's the idea. what has to be worked
   out is how we are getting things in the proper order.  For example, the
   representation of integer (parts) is little endien, so as we travers the
   list we are getting higher-order digits.  The rational recurrences are
   heading in the other direction and I don't know the adjustment for that
   off-hand.  Instead of climbing upward, we are working downward.  That
   seems peculiar.

 * I need to determine how to deal with Q2adic (rationales) separate from
   integers and also how to deal with them because there is a binary point
   placement matter.  I'm not yet (2026-11-18) ready to dig any farther
   into this.  It looks like a costly arithmetic if done at this binary
   level in list structures.
