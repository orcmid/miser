		about failure cases.&nbsp; So far, we have it appear as if nothing has 
		happened, as in the pure-lindy case.&nbsp; The only other useful case 
		would be to have nothing happen -- i.e., no result, or have a 
		program-point behavior.&nbsp; There clearly can be program points, 
		although I am uncertain about the environment connection, because oMiser 
		doesn't seem to need one.&nbsp; I'm also uncertain about how we can 
		reason about programs in the case of such interventions.&nbsp; My idea 
		in the distant past was to somehow confine the functional to places that 
		could be reasoned about more simply and to isolate them and enlarge them 
		as well as can be done.&nbsp; Introduction of extensions that go beyond 
		that needs to still afford it.&nbsp; I don't have any other thoughts

		It turns out, then, that lindies are similar, except sort of in-between 
		precedence-wise.&nbsp; These are if they always exist already and they 
		don't cover any ob.&nbsp; Likewise for primitives.&nbsp; So lindies are 
		a bit between two worlds.&nbsp; The precedence rules now have to

		incorporated.&nbsp; But we do really want to know forwarding of the

        <font size="2">In any interchange formats for oMiser/oFrugal, there must 
		be a normalization required for lindies conveyed in persistent forms, 
		such as XML, whether or not in packages or compressed in other manners.&nbsp; 
		The platform-independent (?) hashing must work properly, and the hashing 
		of lindy UTF-8 expression must be included.&nbsp; This is also the 
		reason that the UTF-8 expression must be retained with the lindy in some 
		manner, one that allows lindies to be garbage-collected.&nbsp; This can 
		work.&nbsp; lindies, as literals, have no applicative interpretation 
		(except as pure lindy forms) and the link could be to something that has 
		the UTF-8 lindy identfier.&nbsp; This does raise some considerations 
		about garbage-collection though.&nbsp; The generational scheme would 
		usually not do anything but sweep away unreachable lindies in the 
		discarded generation.&nbsp; The only way out of that is to have lindies 
		somewhere else.&nbsp; This may be a problem with non-primitive 
		individuals generally.&nbsp; We need to know when an individual is 
		caught in a Cheney copy operation and copied to another generation.&nbsp; 
		Unfortunately, that tells us nothing about ones that are not swept out 
		of the to-be deleted generation.&nbsp; So the definition, wherever it is 
		kept, must be re-forwarded to the literal, or else the lindies are all 
		managed in a different space.&nbsp; Having to reference count them is no 
		help because we won't ever know when they become unreachable if we do 
		generational collection.&nbsp; This is the case for all non-primitive 
		individuals and we need a generic solution.&nbsp; We need to be watchful 
		of precedence also.&nbsp; We'd like that to be implicitly preserved.&nbsp; 
		If a non-primitive individual is forwarded, we do know that.&nbsp; If it 
		is not forwarded but in the scrubbed generation, we know to remove it 
		from wherever we are pinning from.&nbsp; If it is forwarded into a new 
		generation, we can know that.&nbsp; The problem, now, is that we may 
		need to somehow know what generation an individual was established in 
		and when that generation is scrubbed without forwarding the individual 
		into an older generation.&nbsp; This gets messy.&nbsp; At the same time, 
		the generation collection scheme for getting rid of short-lived obs is 
		very important.&nbsp; </font></td>

		with arabic scripts and other RTL caligraphies.&nbsp; There are also 
		matters of glyph compositions that need to be normalized, ideally to the 
		correct single Unicode code point.&nbsp; I need to stage this.&nbsp; 
		Part of this is a Frugal matter, since it is responsible for feeding the 
		desired form to oMiser and also extracting the printable form.&nbsp; 
		This is an oFrugal/oMiser straddling situation, as is the pinning of <b>
		<font face="Courier New">^<i>lindy</i></font><font face="Times New Roman"><i>
		</i></font></b>forms<i><b>.</b></i>&nbsp; Well, not exactly.&nbsp; I do 
		have the need to normalize there, just as I need to do so for lindies 
		generally.&nbsp; So the same normalization holds, although the <b>
		<font face="Courier New">^<i>lindy</i></font></b> has nothing to do with 
		the <b><font face="Courier New"><i>lindy</i></font></b> as an 
		individual. They also must not be confused at the oMiser level, since <b>
		<font face="Courier New">^<i>lindy</i></font></b> can be redefined in 
		the oFrugal input stream and there is no such thing for the oMiser <b>
		<font face="Courier New"><i>lindy</i></font></b>.&nbsp; At the oMiser 
		run-time interface, there must be defensive normalization in the 
		handling of a UTF-8 string though, since we can't count on the 
		view-controller being oFrugal.&nbsp; Until we can get the Unicode rules 
		down pat, we will limit lindies to the C Language locale alphanumerics, 
		plus &quot;-&quot; and &quot;_&quot;.&nbsp; It would be nice if the filtering of UTF8 were 
		straightforward, such as that defined for \uxxxx and \Uxxxxxxxx.&nbsp; 
		We will also allow these, so we need to be cautious in filtering in 
		either direction.&nbsp; That is definitely a future provision and not 
		something we'll entertain at first.&nbsp; The hard part is going to have 
		to do with font capabilities with oFrugal output of lindies.&nbsp; So 
		the introduction of \u-forms is going to be messy.&nbsp; We have to 
		manage that along with the allowance of UTF8 beyond the ISO-648 
		alphanumerics.&nbsp; IMPORTANT: This also matters for how enclosures are 
		presented in CFob.&nbsp; OK, this is already an ob/ topic because of 
		CFob.&nbsp; We need to address this in conjunction with CFob and the 
		ability to near-literal ability of CFob to distinguish obs in a precise
