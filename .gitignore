#
#              .GITIGNORE FOR KEEPING BUILDS OUT OF THE REPOSITORY
#
#   This .gitignore file is designed to eliminate build setups and their
#   output from being committed to and carried in the repository.  This is
#   part of a structure where anyone can do multiple flavors of builds
#   along-side the source without cluttering the repository iself.

# 0.03 2014-12-07-17:59 Tidy Up
#      I am providing local .gitignore for entire solution subdirectories,
#      because of artifacts in addition to Visual Studio's that I might have
#      in .zip archives for solution and project folders.
# 0.02 2014-12-03-17:34 Eliminate Visual Studio Solution Files
#      Solutions and Projects are eliminated because they they are not static.
#      Starter solutions are incorporated in the repository within Zip
#      packages that are extracted to be used, with working copies operated
#      separately entirely on the local system.
# 0.01 2014-12-03-15:42 Decorate for initial orcmid/ShowDefs usage
#      Commentary is added for making this .gitignore specific to the one
#      project.  The exclusions will be expanded and some artifacts that
#      will never appear in this project will be excluded to make the
#      list more manageable.
# 0.00 2014-12-03-16:11 Initial .gitignore from GitHub
#      As part of creation of the repositiory, the GitHub provided for
#      ignoring Visual Studio build artifacts was created automatically.

#                    *** end of .gitignore ***
